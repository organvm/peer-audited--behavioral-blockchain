            <p>
              By creating an account or using the Styx Protocol (&ldquo;Service&rdquo;), you agree to these Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;).

            <p>
              Styx is a peer-audited behavioral accountability platform. Users create behavioral contracts (&ldquo;Oaths&rdquo;)
              backed by financial stakes. Compliance is verified through daily attestations, peer review by the Fury network,
              or automated oracles. Stakes are held in escrow and returned upon successful completion, or forfeited upon failure.
            </p>

            <p>
              When you create an Oath, you commit to a specific behavioral goal for a defined period. You acknowledge that:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1 text-neutral-400">
              <li>Stakes are voluntary and you should only stake amounts you can afford to lose</li>
              <li>Failure to meet your commitment may result in forfeiture of your stake</li>
              <li>Peer reviewers (Furies) make verdict decisions; Styx does not guarantee outcomes</li>

              <li>Three missed attestations result in automatic contract failure</li>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-3">6. Fury Network (Peer Review)</h2>
            <p>
              As a Fury reviewer, you stake your own credibility. False accusations reduce your accuracy score and may
              result in demotion or suspension. Honeypot injections are used to verify reviewer integrity. Your reviews
              are anonymous to the contract holder.

            <p>
              All payment processing is handled by Stripe. Funds are held in escrow (For Benefit Of) accounts managed
              by Styx. Styx is not a bank, investment advisor, or gambling platform. Behavioral stakes are structured
              as commitment devices, not wagers.
