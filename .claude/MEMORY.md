# Styx (peer-audited--behavioral-blockchain) — Project Memory

## Identity
- **Full name:** peer-audited--behavioral-blockchain (codename: Styx)
- **Organ:** ORGAN-III (Ergon) — commercial products
- **Tier:** flagship
- **Status:** CANDIDATE (promoted from LOCAL on 2026-02-24)
- **GitHub org:** labores-profani-crux

## Architecture
- **Monorepo** managed by Turborepo
- `src/api/` — NestJS backend (port 3000)
- `src/web/` — Next.js frontend (port 3001)
- `src/shared/` — shared TypeScript libs (behavioral-logic, integrity, linguistic-cloak)
- `src/mobile/` — React Native (Expo)
- `src/desktop/` — Tauri wrapper
- `src/pitch/` — pitch deck build
- `infra/terraform/` — Render + Cloudflare R2 + WAF
- `docs/` — research, legal, planning, architecture docs

## Key Constants
- Loss aversion lambda: 1.955
- Onboarding bonus: $5 (endowed progress)
- Grace days: 2/month
- BMI floor: 18.5 (Aegis Protocol health safety)
- Recovery contracts: max 30 days, max 3 targets, 3 missed attestations = auto-fail
- Stake tiers: $0 / $20 / $100 / $1,000 / unlimited

## Development
- Node 20, TypeScript strict
- `npm run dev` — turbo dev (API + web)
- `npm test` — turbo test
- `npm run lint` — turbo lint
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (security audit, turbo test+build+lint, Gates 04-07, beta readiness, Terraform validate, Playwright E2E, CodeQL)
- Deploy: tag-triggered to Render via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## Deployment
- **Provider:** Render (Oregon region, starter plans)
- **Services:** API, Web, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **CDN/WAF:** Cloudflare (free tier)
- **Object Storage:** Cloudflare R2 (free tier)
- **Monitoring:** Sentry (active)
- **Production status:** Not yet deployed with real-money settlement

## Linguistic Cloaker
App Store compliance layer — swaps gambling-adjacent terms:
- stake → vault
- bet → commitment
- fury (peer review system) → peer review
- Enforced by `scripts/gatekeeper-scan.sh` and `scripts/validation/04-redacted-build-check.sh`

## Agent Departments
7 seeded agent contexts in `.claude/agents/` — none yet activated:
enterprise, finance, growth, support, ops, product, legal

## Key Issues (Blocked on Human Action)
- #132: KYC integration
- #133: High-risk merchant account
- #136: Skill-based contest whitepaper + counsel sign-off
- #146: App Store UGC moderation submission
- #148: Cross-jurisdictional consent matrix

## Unexecuted Plans (High Value)
- `ask-styx-static-chat` — standalone chat SPA for GH Pages

- `stub-placeholder-inventory` — grep-based stub/TODO search (subordinate to above)

## Security Remediation & Release Engineering (2026-05-26)
Merged to `main` as squash **f45c80c** (PR #607, squashed 6 commits). Audited the
#605 "security & correctness hardening" commit, found **89 issues**, fixed all of
them. Verified locally: `tsc --noEmit` clean + **994 tests / 95 suites green**.
Co-located specs updated for every behavior change. (CI `build_and_test` did NOT
run — see Known Gaps.)

- **Money/idempotency:** Stripe idempotency keys on `transferFunds`/`processIAP`/
  `recordUsage`/capture/lock; DB-enforced ledger `idempotency_key` (migration
  **030**) with a PARTIAL unique index → `ON CONFLICT (idempotency_key) WHERE
  idempotency_key IS NOT NULL DO NOTHING`; per-(run,type) settlement dedupe;
  concurrent-reclaim status guards; `payment_intent.succeeded` verifies amount +
  currency before activating a contract.
- **Auth:** banned-user guard on wallet/oracles; **`ENTERPRISE_SSO_SECRET` is now
  REQUIRED** (no `JWT_SECRET` fallback) — `/auth/enterprise` rejects until it is
  set; logout revokes refresh tokens even on an expired access token; `CurrentUser`
  fails closed; throttle on refresh/logout/csrf.
- **Anti-fraud:** cross-contract pHash dedup restored; `isHoneypot` no longer
  returned to auditors; PASS+FAIL honeypots; dHash; manipulated media → MANUAL_REVIEW.
- **Privacy/GDPR/SSRF:** transactional + complete erasure; keyed-HMAC email
  pseudonymization; k-anonymity suppression; webhook delivery rewritten to
  `node:https`/`http` and **pinned to the validated IP** (custom `lookup`) to close
  the DNS-rebinding SSRF; redirects no longer followed.
- **Ledger/consensus:** per-user (not per-contract) grace-day cap; `verifyChain`
  recomputes from the running head; BIGSERIAL `sequence_index` advanced via `setval`;
  idempotent consensus side effects; non-transactional `resolveContract` fallback no
  longer strands a terminally-resolved contract.
- **KYC (PRV16 decision):** enforcement is now **default-ON in production**
  (fail-closed; disabled only by explicit `KYC_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED=false`, logged at
  error level). Opt-in outside production. NOTE: this changes the enforcement
  DEFAULT only — the actual KYC **provider integration (#132) is still pending/mock**.
- **Tier boundary (SH6 decision):** confirmed exclusive (`<`) — a stake exactly at a
  threshold escalates to the stricter tier. No code change.
- **Release engineering:** `ci.yml` `build_and_test` is now a **blocking** gate
  (removed the repo-wide `continue-on-error` that made red builds report green);
  `npm ci`; `merge_group` trigger; `.github/rulesets/main.json` (branch protection as
  code) + README; `docs/architecture/branching-and-release-strategy.md` (canonical
  trunk-based model).
- **New required env var:** `ENTERPRISE_SSO_SECRET`.

### Known Gaps / Operator TODO (do not lose)
- **`build_and_test` is NOT running on PRs** (repo Actions gating, not a YAML bug).
  FIX THIS before applying `main.json` — a required check that never reports would
  deadlock every merge.
- **CodeQL SSRF alert** persists as a static false-positive (real rebinding vuln is
  fixed via IP-pinning); needs a one-click maintainer **dismissal** in Security →
  Code scanning. The CodeQL `ci.yml:codeql configuration not found` artifact resolves
  on its own now that `main` no longer defines that duplicate config.
- **Apply `.github/rulesets/main.json`**, set `ENTERPRISE_SSO_SECRET` per env. Migration
  030 runs via the deploy pipeline.
- **IRF master registry** (`meta-organvm/organvm-corpvs-testamentvm/INST-INDEX-RERUM-FACIENDARUM.md`)
  was NOT updated — it lives outside this repo and this session's GitHub access is
  restricted to `a-organvm/peer-audited--behavioral-blockchain`. Operator must run
  `organvm irf` to propagate. See `docs/audit/2026-05-26-index-propagation-and-vacuum-log.md`.
- **VACUUM: Logos Documentation Layer is MISSING** (`docs/logos/` — Symmetry 0.0 per
  docs/CLAUDE.md). Logged with a plan in the propagation log; not yet built.
