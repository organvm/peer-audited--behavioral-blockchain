# Styx Codebase Implementation Gap Audit

## Objective
Conduct a thorough audit of the Styx peer-audited behavioral market codebase to identify implementation gaps and categorize completeness (COMPLETE, PARTIAL, STUB, MISSING).

## Scope
Repository: `~/Workspace/organvm-iii-ergon/peer-audited--behavioral-blockchain`

## Task Breakdown (9 Steps)

### Task 1: Grep for Development Markers
**Objective**: Find all TODO, FIXME, HACK, "Tasks for AI Engineer", stub, placeholder, "not implemented" markers across TypeScript source.

**Commands**:
- Grep across `.ts` and `.tsx` files (case insensitive) for markers
- Return count and filenames for each marker type

**Expected Output**: Categorized list of markers by type and location

---

### Task 2: API Endpoint Coverage (Route Decorators)
**Objective**: Identify which API endpoints from spec are implemented as actual route handlers.

**Commands**:
- Grep for NestJS route decorators: `@Get`, `@Post`, `@Patch`, `@Delete`, `@Put`
- Focus on controller files in `src/api/src/modules/*/`
- Extract endpoint paths and HTTP methods

**Expected Output**: Table of routes by controller with HTTP methods

---

### Task 3: Read Contracts Controller
**File**: `src/api/src/modules/contracts/contracts.controller.ts`

**Objective**: Determine which contract endpoints are implemented.

**Expected Output**: List of implemented endpoints with their decorators and method signatures

---

### Task 4: Read Users Controller
**File**: `src/api/src/modules/users/` (find the actual controller filename)

**Objective**: Determine which user management endpoints are implemented.

**Expected Output**: List of implemented endpoints (CRUD, profile, etc.)

---

### Task 5: Read Admin Controller
**File**: `src/api/src/modules/admin/` or similar

**Objective**: Identify admin panel endpoints (LedgerInspector, ExilePanel, MacroReview, B2B).

**Expected Output**: List of admin endpoints and their implementation status

---

### Task 6: Validation Scripts Assessment
**Directory**: `scripts/validation/`

**Objective**: Review all 4 validation gates and assess if they contain real logic or placeholders.

**Files to check**:
- `01-phantom-money-check.ts`
- `02-simulator-spoof-check.ts`
- `03-the-full-loop.ts`
- `04-redacted-build-check.sh`

**Expected Output**: Table showing each script, what it validates, and implementation status (COMPLETE/PARTIAL/STUB)

---

### Task 7: CI Configuration Review
**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Objective**: Assess CI coverage (linting, testing, build steps).

**Expected Output**: Summary of CI stages, dependencies, and coverage

---

### Task 8: Frontend Page Completeness
**Files**:
- `src/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `src/web/app/fury/page.tsx`
- `src/web/app/wallet/page.tsx`

**Objective**: Assess frontend page implementations (real components vs stub/placeholder UI).

**Expected Output**: Per-page assessment (COMPLETE/PARTIAL/STUB) with notes on key features

---

### Task 9: Mobile Workspace Inventory
**Directory**: `src/mobile/`

**Objective**: List all files and assess real vs placeholder implementations.

**Expected Output**: File tree with status annotations (COMPLETE/PARTIAL/STUB/MISSING for each major subsystem)

---

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Parallel Reads (Run in parallel)
- Task 1: Grep markers across codebase
- Task 2: Grep route decorators across controllers
- Task 6: List and skim validation scripts
- Task 7: Read CI config

### Phase 2: Sequential File Reads (Run sequentially)
- Task 3: Read contracts.controller.ts
- Task 4: Find and read users controller
- Task 5: Find and read admin controller
- Task 8: Read dashboard/fury/wallet pages
- Task 9: List mobile workspace

### Phase 3: Analysis & Synthesis
- Compile all findings into categorized inventory
- Categorize each component as: COMPLETE, PARTIAL, STUB, MISSING
- Highlight critical gaps and priority areas for implementation

---

## Output Format

Final report will organize findings by:

### By Component
- **API Endpoints** (contracts, users, admin, etc.)
- **Services** (ledger, fury-router, escrow, etc.)
- **Validation Gates** (4 scripts)
- **CI Pipeline** (coverage and stages)
- **Frontend Pages** (dashboard, fury, wallet)
- **Mobile Workspace** (subsystems)

### By Status
```
## COMPLETE (Fully Implemented)
- [List of components]

## PARTIAL (Partially Implemented)
- [List with gaps noted]

## STUB (Placeholder/Minimal)
- [List with notes]

## MISSING (Not Implemented)
- [List of missing components]
```

---

## Success Criteria
- All 9 tasks executed and findings compiled
- Each component clearly categorized
- Actionable inventory identifying priority gaps for AI engineers
- Accurate reflection of current implementation state

---

**Status**: Pending user approval to execute. Ready to begin upon confirmation.
