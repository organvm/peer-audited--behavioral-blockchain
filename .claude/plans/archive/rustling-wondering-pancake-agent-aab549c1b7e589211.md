# Styx Frontend Completeness & Cross-Cutting Concerns Investigation

**Project**: peer-audited--behavioral-blockchain (Styx)  
**Location**: ~/Workspace/organvm-iii-ergon/peer-audited--behavioral-blockchain  
**Status**: CANDIDATE promotion  
**Created**: 2026-02-23

## Investigation Scope

Comprehensive exploration of frontend maturity, shared infrastructure quality, and cross-cutting concerns across 5 workspaces (web, mobile, desktop, shared, api).

## 10-Point Investigation Plan

### 1. Explore src/web/ App Router Structure
- [ ] Check Next.js 16 app directory layout
- [ ] Map all routes: /, /dashboard, /fury, /wallet, /pitch, /hr, /tavern, /admin, /settings, /profile, /login, /register, /contracts/new, /contracts/[id]
- [ ] Verify page completeness (stub vs. implemented)
- [ ] Check API integration (real endpoints vs. mock data)
- [ ] Review component structure and patterns

### 2. Examine Linguistic Cloaker
- [ ] Read src/web/utils/linguistic-cloak.ts
- [ ] Verify vocabulary mappings (stake→vault, bet→commitment, fury→peer review)
- [ ] Check coverage (all stakeholder-facing strings?)
- [ ] Assess runtime swap mechanism
- [ ] Verify App Store/Stripe compliance enforcement

### 3. Examine src/mobile/ Screens & Services
- [ ] Map all screens in src/mobile/screens/
- [ ] Check services: ApiClient, SessionService, OfflineCache, UploadService, NotificationService, EnterpriseSSO
- [ ] Verify completeness (stub vs. implemented)
- [ ] Check placeholder stubs (native Swift/Kotlin requirements)
- [ ] Assess platform readiness (iOS/Android)

### 4. Examine src/desktop/ Panels & Config
- [ ] Read Tauri 2.0 config
- [ ] Map panels: LedgerInspector, MacroReview, ExilePanel, B2BOrchestration, LoginScreen
- [ ] Check Vite + React integration
- [ ] Verify completeness and maturity

### 5. Review src/shared/ Structure & Quality
- [ ] Check exports from src/shared/libs/
- [ ] Verify constants: behavioral-logic.ts, integrity.ts, geofencing.ts, billing.ts
- [ ] Validate algorithm implementations (Integrity Score, Fury Accuracy, behavioral constants)
- [ ] Check type definitions and tsconfig path aliases
- [ ] Assess shared infrastructure quality

### 6. Analyze turbo.json Build Pipeline
- [ ] Check workspace configuration
- [ ] Verify build dependency graph
- [ ] Check test & lint pipeline
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks or optimization opportunities

### 7. Review Makefile Targets
- [ ] List all available targets (install, dev, build, test, etc.)
- [ ] Check docker-compose orchestration
- [ ] Verify convenience commands

### 8. Review Package.json Dependencies
- [ ] Root package.json: workspaces, shared scripts
- [ ] src/api: NestJS, BullMQ, Stripe, pg versions
- [ ] src/web: Next.js, React, Tailwind, p5.js versions
- [ ] src/mobile: React Native version, platform-specific deps
- [ ] src/desktop: Tauri, Vite, React versions
- [ ] src/shared: tsc, type-checking setup

### 9. Check Environment Variable Validation
- [ ] Read .env.example
- [ ] Look for zod schemas or env validation
- [ ] Verify required vs. optional vars
- [ ] Check validation in entrypoints (API, web, mobile, desktop)

### 10. Look for Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Check logging setup (Winston, Pino, or custom?)
- [ ] Look for metrics (Prometheus, StatsD, or custom?)
- [ ] Check health endpoints and health checks
- [ ] Verify error tracking (Sentry or custom?)
- [ ] Check performance monitoring setup

## Deliverables

### Summary Sections
1. **Frontend Maturity Assessment**: Readiness of web, mobile, and desktop for production
2. **Shared Infrastructure Quality**: Strength and completeness of src/shared/
3. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Environment handling, monitoring, observability, security patterns
4. **Completeness Matrix**: Implementation status across workspaces
5. **Gaps & Recommendations**: What's missing, what needs attention

### Output Format
- Clear matrix showing stub vs. implemented status
- Code paths to key files
- Specific recommendations for promotion readiness
- List of files examined with line counts and key findings

## Investigation Strategy

1. Start with build pipeline (turbo.json, Makefile) to understand structure
2. Examine root-level configuration (package.json, .env)
3. Systematically walk through each workspace (web, mobile, desktop, shared)
4. Check cross-cutting concerns last (they may depend on workspace understanding)
5. Build completeness matrix as findings accumulate
6. Synthesize into final summary with actionable recommendations

## Status: READY TO EXECUTE

All investigation points are well-defined. Ready to proceed with parallel reads of Makefile, turbo.json, and root package.json, followed by systematic workspace exploration.
