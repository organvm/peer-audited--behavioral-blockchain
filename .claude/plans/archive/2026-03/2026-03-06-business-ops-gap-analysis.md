# Styx Documentation Audit — Comprehensive Business & Operations Gap Analysis
**Plan ID**: `2026-03-06-styx-documentation-audit-agent-8f127a8d`  
**Date**: 2026-03-06  
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS  
**Mode**: Read-only analysis (no file creation or modification)

---

## Objective
Conduct a comprehensive audit of the Styx project repository to identify existing documentation and reveal gaps across six critical business/operational categories:
1. Go-to-market strategy, launch plan, and user acquisition
2. Business metrics, KPIs, revenue targets, and MRR goals
3. Operational readiness (monitoring, support, incident response, SLAs)
4. Post-launch iteration, user feedback loops, and A/B testing frameworks
5. Hiring plan, team building, and contractor procurement
6. Marketing, content strategy, and PR documentation

Additionally analyze `render.yaml`, `.env.example`, and deployment-related documents for operational readiness configuration.

## Previous Search Results Summary

**Files Identified Across Repository:**
- ~90+ markdown files in docs/ directories
- 5+ text files in docs/ directories
- Key directories: planning/, research/, brainstorm/, architecture/, legal/, thesis/
- NO files found matching search terms: "gtm", "marketing", "acquisition" (suggests alternative naming or gaps)

## Gap Analysis Framework

For each of the six categories, compile:
- **What Exists**: List specific documents/sections found
- **What's Missing**: Critical gaps identified
- **Naming Convention Anomalies**: Terms used instead of expected keywords
- **Confidence Level**: How complete is the coverage (%)
- **Risk Assessment**: Impact of gaps on launch readiness

## Notes
- All reads are sequential (dependencies exist between phases)
- Plan assumes default Styx directory structure from CLAUDE.md
- Any missing files/directories will be noted and skipped gracefully
- Analysis will focus on **content gaps** not presentation quality
- Final report will be written to `~/.claude/plans/` with dated filename
