# Comprehensive AI Session Audit & Unimplemented Plan Triage

**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Project:** `peer-audited--behavioral-blockchain` (Styx)
**Repo:** `organvm-iii-ergon/peer-audited--behavioral-blockchain`

---

## Context

The user requires a 100% ingestion audit of all AI-generated artifacts across Claude, Gemini, and Codex sessions for the Styx project. The project has accumulated massive AI-driven development history (159 commits, 76 Claude sessions + 696 subagent sessions, 11 Claude plans, 8 Codex plans, 28 planning docs, 4 brainstorm transcripts, a doctoral thesis, and 50+ open GitHub issues). The goal is to:

1. Inventory all prompts/sessions across tools
2. Identify missed opportunities in prompting cycles
3. Audit plan files against implementation status
4. Create GitHub issues for unimplemented plans

---

## Section 1: Complete Session Inventory

### Claude Code Sessions
- **Location:** `~/.claude/projects/-Users-[user]-Workspace-organvm-iii-ergon-peer-audited--behavioral-blockchain/`
- **Main sessions:** 76 JSONL files (each = one conversation)
- **Subagent sessions:** 696 JSONL files (spawned by main sessions)
- **Date range:** 2026-02-22 through 2026-03-06 (13 days)
- **Plan files:** 11 in `.claude/plans/`

### Gemini Sessions
- **GEMINI.md:** Present at project root (context/instruction file, not session log)
- **No `.gemini/` directory** in the project — Gemini was used via Google AI Studio / web, not Gemini CLI locally
- **Brainstorm transcripts (Gemini/ChatGPT attributed):**
  - `docs/brainstorm/brainstorm--chatgpt--2026-03-03.md` — MVP Master Plan (ChatGPT)
  - `docs/brainstorm/brainstorm--transcript--2026-02-20.md` — Original voice recording transcript (founder conversation)
  - `docs/brainstorm/brainstorm--transcript--2026-02-25.md` — Lottery/probation model ideation
  - `docs/brainstorm/brainstorm--transcript--2026-02-27.md` — Pod/cohort structure brainstorm
  - `docs/brainstorm/brainstorm--motivation-validation.md` — Motivation validation research
- **Gemini global plans (unrelated to this project):** 4 files in `~/.local/share/gemini/plans/` (Claude hang fixes, MCP errors)
- **Estimated Gemini prompt count:** ~120 (per `portfolio_analysis_summary.md` cross-project audit)

### Codex Sessions
- **Location:** `.codex/plans/` (8 plan files)
- **No session JSONL equivalent** — Codex stores plans only, not conversation transcripts
- **Date range:** 2026-03-03 through 2026-03-05 (3 days)
- **Estimated prompt count:** 0 direct Codex CLI prompts (per cross-project audit); plans were likely generated via Codex web/API

### Other AI Tools
- **No `.specstory/`, `.cursor/`, `.windsurf/`, `.aider*` artifacts found**
- **No Copilot session data** (Copilot used for inline completions, no plan artifacts)

## Section 3: Prompting Cycle Analysis & Missed Opportunities

### Pattern 1: Checkpoint Churn (4 "checkpoint" commits on 03-04)
Commits `ecfb408`, `92485cb`, `ad27707`, `98df490` are all "chore: checkpoint all local changes" within 2 hours. This indicates context window exhaustion forcing session restarts without completing the task. **Missed opportunity:** Use `.claude/MEMORY.md` or plan files to persist state across sessions instead of raw checkpoint commits.

### Pattern 2: Duplicate Community Health Plans
Plans #7 and #8 (`.claude/plans/2026-02-28-community-docs-gaps.md` and `community-health-files.md` and `community-health-update.md`) are three files covering the same work. Content filter issues forced retries. **Missed opportunity:** After first content filter block, should have used neutral language upfront or piped file content through Write tool without reproducing security-domain terminology.

### Pattern 3: Evaluation-to-Growth Fatigue (5+ overlapping E2G documents)
- `.claude/plans/2026-02-28-e2g-roadmap-tasks.md`
- `.codex/plans/2026-03-05-evaluation-to-growth-exhaustive-implementation.md` (v1)
- `.codex/plans/2026-03-05-evaluation-to-growth-exhaustive-implementation-v2.md`
- `docs/planning/planning--evaluation-to-growth--project-wide--2026-03-05.md`
- `docs/planning/evaluation-to-growth--full-breath-audit--2026-03-06.md`
- `docs/planning/2026-03-05-evaluation-to-growth-final-report.md`
- `docs/doc--evaluation-to-growth-review.md`

Seven documents from the same lens. **Missed opportunity:** Should have consolidated into a single living document with revision tracking rather than spawning new files per session.

### Pattern 4: Research Without Implementation Tickets
10 competitor deep-dives completed (Beeminder, stickK, Forfeit, etc.) but the `second-pass-unresolved-research-tickets` Codex plan that was supposed to convert findings into implementation-ready tickets was never executed. Research closed as GitHub issues (#149-158) but no follow-up feature extraction.

### Pattern 5: Codex Plans as Dead Letters
6 of 8 Codex plans are NOT fully implemented. Codex was used primarily as a planning oracle, not an executor. Claude did the actual implementation. **Missed opportunity:** Codex plans should have been fed directly into Claude sessions as execution instructions.

### Pattern 6: No Gemini CLI Integration
Despite GEMINI.md existing, no Gemini CLI was used in-project. All Gemini usage was via web/AI Studio for brainstorming. **Missed opportunity:** Gemini CLI could have handled research-heavy tasks (competitor analysis, literature review) to parallelize work across tools.

## Section 5: Execution Plan

### Step 1: Add portfolio files to .gitignore
Append to `.gitignore`:
```
audit_report.md
portfolio_analysis_summary.md
portfolio_plans_combined.md
portfolio_files.txt
```

### Step 2: Create "Plan Debt" milestone
```bash
gh api repos/organvm-iii-ergon/peer-audited--behavioral-blockchain/milestones \
  -f title="Plan Debt Triage" \
  -f description="Unimplemented plans from AI session audit (2026-03-06)" \
  -f state=open
```

### Step 3: Create 7 GitHub issues with labels + milestone
Use `gh issue create` for each issue defined in Section 4:
- Labels: category labels + `unimplemented-plan`
- Milestone: "Plan Debt Triage" (created in Step 2)
- Structured body with source plan reference, acceptance criteria

Issue-to-milestone mapping:
| Issue | Milestone | Priority |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| BetaReadinessContract service | Plan Debt Triage | P1 |
| Doc-intelligence pipeline | Plan Debt Triage | P2 |
| Research-to-ticket pipeline | Plan Debt Triage | P2 |
| Investor deck/exec summary | Plan Debt Triage | P1 |
| Judge frontend panels | Plan Debt Triage | P2 |
| E2G final mapping report | Plan Debt Triage | P2 |
| FUNDING.yml | Plan Debt Triage | P3 |

### Step 4: Add issues to GitHub Project board
The org project "Ephemera Engine Roadmap" (PVT_kwDODwtKPs4BP83R) exists but belongs to a different repo. Will create a new project or skip if the user prefers manual board assignment. Alternatively, use existing milestones for tracking (milestones 1-4 already exist for Beta/Gamma/Delta/Omega gates).

### Step 5: Write permanent audit artifact
Create `docs/planning/planning--ai-session-audit--2026-03-06.md` containing:
- Sections 1-3 of this plan (inventory, plan audit matrix, prompting analysis)
- Cross-reference table to the 7 new GitHub issues
- Session count statistics

### Step 6: Commit
```bash
git add .gitignore docs/planning/planning--ai-session-audit--2026-03-06.md
git commit -m "docs: comprehensive AI session audit — 7 unimplemented plan issues filed"
```

### Verification
- `gh issue list --label unimplemented-plan` shows 7 new issues
- `gh api repos/.../milestones` shows "Plan Debt Triage" milestone with 7 issues
- `docs/planning/planning--ai-session-audit--2026-03-06.md` exists
- `.gitignore` includes the 4 portfolio files
- No duplicate issues (cross-checked against 50+ existing open issues)

### Files Modified
| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `.gitignore` | Append 4 portfolio file exclusions |
| `docs/planning/planning--ai-session-audit--2026-03-06.md` | Create (permanent audit record) |

### GitHub Resources Created
| Resource | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Issues | 7 (labeled `unimplemented-plan`) |
| Milestone | 1 ("Plan Debt Triage") |
