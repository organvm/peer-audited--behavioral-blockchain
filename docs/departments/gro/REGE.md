# REGE: Growth & Marketing

## 1. Mission & Scope

Growth & Marketing owns the entire acquisition funnel for Styx, from first impression to activated user or practitioner lead. In a pre-revenue behavioral-contract startup, this department operates under severe constraints: zero paid media budget, a product category that does not yet exist in consumer vocabulary ("peer-audited behavioral escrow"), and a wedge market (no-contact breakup recovery) that demands sensitivity in messaging. Loss aversion research (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Gneezy & Rustichini, 2000) underpins both the product and the marketing thesis: the same lambda that makes $39 stakes feel like $76 of potential loss also makes free-to-try messaging ineffective. GRO must educate the market on why financial stakes work, not apologize for their existence.

The department serves two distinct funnels: **B2C direct** (consumers searching for breakup recovery tools, accountability apps, and commitment devices) and **B2B practitioner acquisition** (therapists, coaches, and EAPs who assign contracts to clients). B2B is the primary lever — each practitioner partner brings 5-20 clients, making one practitioner sign-up worth 10x a single consumer conversion. GRO generates demand; B2B closes it.

## 2. Operational Scope

### Daily (D)

- **D1:** Social media engagement — respond to mentions, breakup recovery communities (Reddit r/ExNoContact, r/BreakUps), coach/therapist forums; share user-permission stories
- **D2:** Content distribution — syndicate latest blog post or social proof to active channels (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram stories)
- **D3:** Inbound lead triage — tag and route practitioner inquiries to B2B within 4 hours; flag consumer support issues to CXS
- **D4:** Community listening — monitor sentiment in breakup recovery subreddits, Facebook groups, and coach Slack communities for content ideas and objection patterns

### Weekly (W)

- **W1:** Publish one content piece — blog post, case study, practitioner guide, or research summary; topics drawn from content-calendar.md (G2)
- **W2:** SEO keyword tracking — pull rank data for 25 target keywords (breakup accountability, commitment device app, no-contact contract, therapist tools); update seo-strategy.md (G3)
- **W3:** Ad performance review — if any paid experiments running, review CPA/CAC against $12 target; pause underperformers within 48 hours
- **W4:** Practitioner content creation — draft one piece of practitioner-facing collateral (one-pager, case study, webinar invite) for B2B pipeline

### Monthly (M)

- **M1:** Content performance analysis — rank all published pieces by organic traffic, time-on-page, and conversion (email capture or contract creation); identify top 3 for repurposing
- **M2:** Channel ROI review — compare acquisition cost and volume across organic search, social, referral, practitioner partner, and any paid channels; reallocate effort to top 2 channels
- **M3:** Email nurture audit — review open rates, click rates, and unsubscribe rates on all automated sequences; flag sequences below 20% open rate
- **M4:** Competitor content scan — review what Beeminder, StickK, and new entrants are publishing; identify gaps Styx can own

### Quarterly (Q)

- **Q1:** GTM strategy review — revisit gtm-strategy.md (G1) against actual acquisition data; update phase timelines and success criteria
- **Q2:** Brand audit — review consistency of messaging, tone, and visual identity across all channels; check for regulatory compliance on financial claims
- **Q3:** ICP alignment with B2B — joint session with B2B to refine practitioner persona based on actual partner data; update targeting criteria
- **Q4:** Backlog prioritization — evaluate deferred artifacts (G4-G6) for promotion to active

## 3. Artifacts Registry

| ID | Name | Path | Phase | Staleness | Last Updated | Status |
|----|------|------|-------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| G1 | GTM Strategy | `artifacts/gtm-strategy.md` | hardening | 30d | 2026-03-08 | active |
| G2 | Content Calendar | `artifacts/content-calendar.md` | hardening | 14d | 2026-03-08 | active |

| G4 | Paid Acquisition Playbook | `artifacts/paid-acquisition.md` | — | — | — | dormant |
| G5 | Referral Program Design | `artifacts/referral-program.md` | — | — | — | dormant |
| G6 | Practitioner Co-Marketing Kit | `artifacts/co-marketing-kit.md` | — | — | — | dormant |
| G10 | Audience Growth Engine (portable playbook) | `../../playbooks/playbook--audience-growth-engine.md` | hardening | 90d | 2026-06-01 | active |
| G11 | Audience Growth — Styx/Jessica Instance | `../../planning/planning--audience-growth-engine--styx-instance--2026-06-01.md` | hardening | 30d | 2026-06-01 | active |

**Staleness rules:** G1 stale after 90 days without review. G2 stale after 14 days. G3 stale after 30 days. G10 (portable engine) stale after 90 days. G11 (Styx instance) stale after 30 days — it drives the live Jessica content engine. G11's derived assets (30-day calendar, content asset pack, audience-as-product model, engagement economics, metrics tracker) live alongside it in `docs/planning/planning--*--2026-06-01.md` and are governed by the same content-quality and human-checkpoint rules below.

**Canonical channel-split source:** the Host/Product dual-channel pattern used by G10/G11 is the generalization of `../../planning/planning--dual-channel-audience-architecture--2026-03-10.md` and `../../planning/planning--market-attack-plan--2026-03-10.md`. Treat those two as canonical Styx detail; G10 is the portable abstraction re-runnable for sibling ventures.

## 4. Generative Prompts (GEN:)

### GEN:content-piece

- **Trigger:** W1 cadence (weekly) or content-calendar.md slot approaching within 3 days
- **Input:** Topic from G2, target keyword from G3, audience (consumer or practitioner), current conversion data
- **Action:** Draft 800-1500 word blog post optimized for target keyword; include one data point from behavioral economics research; include CTA (consumer: create first Oath; practitioner: book demo)

- **Output:** Channel activation plan in `data/channel-plans/YYYY-QN-{channel}.md`
- **Guardrails:** One channel at a time. Do not activate arms without human approval. Never recommend activating a channel that requires paid spend without FIN sign-off.

## 5. Self-Critique Rules (CRIT:)

### CRIT:content-quality

- **Cadence:** Every content piece before publication
- **Check:** Does the piece (a) contain at least one behavioral economics citation, (b) avoid medical/financial claims, (c) match the target keyword, (d) include a clear CTA?
- **Output:** Pass/fail annotation on draft
- **Escalate:** Two consecutive fails trigger LEG review of all pending content

- **Trigger:** G2 (content-calendar.md) not updated for >14 days
- **Action:** Auto-generate next 4 weekly topics based on (a) top-performing past content, (b) upcoming product milestones from PRD, (c) seasonal relevance (New Year's resolutions, back-to-school, breakup season peaks in January/March)
- **Guardrails:** Generated topics are proposals only — require human approval before scheduling

### HEAL:seo-rank-drop

- **Trigger:** Any top-10 keyword drops below position 20
- **Action:** Diagnose cause (technical: crawl errors, indexing issues; content: competitor outranked; authority: backlink loss). If content-related, trigger GEN:content-piece for a refresh. If technical, emit signal to OPS.
- **Guardrails:** Do not publish refreshed content without CRIT:content-quality pass

### HEAL:channel-death

- **Trigger:** Any active channel delivers zero conversions for 14 consecutive days
- **Action:** Verify tracking is intact (not a measurement failure). If tracking confirmed working, pause investment in channel and redistribute effort to top 2 performing channels. Log decision in `data/channel-reports/`.
- **Guardrails:** Do not kill a channel permanently — move to 30-day monitoring. Channels can be reactivated on Q1 review.

## 8. Human Checkpoints

1. **Content publication approval** — Every blog post, case study, and practitioner-facing document requires human review before publication. No auto-publish.
2. **Paid spend authorization** — Any paid acquisition experiment requires human approval of budget, targeting, and creative before launch. Maximum $500/experiment without escalation.
3. **Practitioner testimonial consent** — No practitioner name, practice name, or client outcome may be used in marketing without signed written consent and LEG review.
4. **Brand positioning change** — Any change to the positioning statement, tagline, or core messaging framework requires human approval from product leadership.
5. **Channel kill decision** — HEAL:channel-death proposes pausing a channel; human must confirm before execution.
