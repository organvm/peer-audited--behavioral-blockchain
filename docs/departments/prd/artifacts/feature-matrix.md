## Feature Dependencies

```
Stripe FBO ──> Contract Creation ──> Fury Assignment ──> Proof Review ──> Settlement
    │                                      │
    └──> Wallet Display                    └──> Integrity Score Update
                                                      │
                                                      └──> Stake Limit Adjustment
```

**Critical path for beta:** Stripe FBO must be fully operational before any contract can be created. Fury pool must have minimum 15 auditors (3 quorums of 5) before contracts can be verified. These are hard prerequisites, not features that can be partially shipped.
