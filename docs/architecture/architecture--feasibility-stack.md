# Pillar 5: Technical Feasibility \& Architecture

The Objective: To determine how to actually build the "Blockchain of Truth" without spending millions on custom hardware.
> "Act as a Lead Software Architect. I am designing a habit-tracking app that requires strict, un-fakeable validation of user activities to prevent cheating.
> Please provide a technical feasibility report on the following:
>  * Integrating wearable health APIs (Apple HealthKit, Google Fit, Whoop, Fitbit): How can we enforce 'read-only' data that strips out manual user entries?
>  * Integrating financial APIs: What is the technical effort required to use Plaid or a similar open-source API to verify that a user saved a specific amount of money without giving the app access to move those funds?
>  * Video Validation: What are the best practices and costs associated with hosting user-uploaded video proof, and how can we build a basic anonymous peer-review routing system?
>  * Recommend an optimal, cost-effective tech stack (e.g., Node.js, specific databases) to handle a real-time, financially staked leaderboard system."
>

Below is a feasibility/architecture pass focused on: (1) what is actually technically enforceable; (2) how to get 80–90% of the “truth” benefits without any custom hardware; and (3) a concrete, cost-conscious stack that can run a financially staked leaderboard.

***

## 1. Design Principles for a “Blockchain of Truth” Without Custom Hardware

Core constraints to keep in mind:

- You cannot make cheating *impossible*; you can make it **expensive, inconvenient, and probabilistically detectable**.
- You are fundamentally trusting OS-level and bank-level “oracles” (HealthKit/Fit/WHOOP/Fitbit, Plaid/open banking, and video + peer review).
- Architecturally, you want:
    - **Read-only integration** everywhere possible.
    - **Tamper-evident logs** (hash-chained event store) rather than a heavy blockchain.
    - **Separation of concerns**: verification services separate from the game/UX layer.
    - **Deterministic rules** about what counts as valid evidence (data sources, thresholds, time windows).

The rest of this answer walks through each domain and then proposes a stack.

***

## 2. Wearable Health APIs: Enforcing “Read-Only” \& Stripping Manual Entries

### 2.1 Apple HealthKit

HealthKit is well-suited for your use case, because:

- Your app can request **read-only permissions** to specific data types (steps, workouts, heart rate, etc.) and simply **never request write permissions**. That alone prevents your app from “forging” data in HealthKit; only Apple and other apps can provide it.[^1_1]
- Each `HKSample` has:
    - A **source** (`HKSource`) with a `bundleIdentifier`, which tells you which app wrote it.
    - Optional **metadata**, including `HKWasUserEntered` / `HKMetadataKeyWasUserEntered`, indicating the user manually entered that record.[^1_2][^1_3]

Two enforcement layers:

1. **Filter out manually entered samples:**
    - Use predicates like `HKQuery.predicateForObjectsWithMetadataKey(HKMetadataKeyWasUserEntered, allowedValues: [false])` to exclude manually entered samples where metadata exists.[^1_2]
    - For types that do not carry metadata consistently, fall back to:
        - Ignoring samples with `source.bundleIdentifier == "com.apple.Health"` (the Health app itself, used for manual entries).[^1_4]
        - Preferring data whose source bundle is a known device or first-party tracking app (e.g., `com.apple.health.Heartbeat`, specific watch apps, etc.).
2. **Whitelist trusted data sources:**
    - Maintain a list of allowed bundle IDs for legitimate sensor-producing apps (Apple Watch, official device companion apps) and ignore everything else.
    - For example, for step count habits, accept only measurements whose source is the iPhone/Watch motion coprocessor or a known wearable app.

**Practical implication:** You can reliably discard Health app manual entries and much of the hand-tuned junk, but you cannot fully stop someone from spoofing via 3rd-party apps or physically abusing the device. That is acceptable if you combine it with other signals (patterns over time, video, peer review).

***

### 2.2 Google Fit

Google Fit is messier: there is **no official, explicit “manual vs auto” flag** in the History API.[^1_5]

However, you can approximate:

- **Data sources / stream identifiers**
    - Google Fit data points expose an original `DataSource` and a `streamIdentifier`. Developers have found that streams containing certain substrings (e.g., `soft_step_delta`) correspond to sensor-derived steps vs. user-entered ones.[^1_5]
    - You can similarly identify “user_input” type streams and treat them as manual.
- **Use the Sensors API for real-time tracking:**
    - For in-session habits (e.g., “walk 2km in the next 60 minutes”), you can use the **Sensors API** to read **raw step and heart-rate data in real time** from `DataSource.TYPE_RAW` on the device or wearable, instead of trusting the retrospective History aggregation.[^1_6]
    - That data is much harder to forge on the fly without rooted devices or replay attacks.

Recommended pattern:

- For **ongoing challenges** (day- or week- scale): Aggregate using History API, but filter by:
    - Data source type: prefer `TYPE_RAW` from built-in sensors or known wearable manufacturers.
    - Stream identifiers: discard streams that match known manual-entry patterns.
- For **high-stakes, time-bounded challenges** (e.g., staked 1-hour runs): Require the user to activate a session where:
    - Your app connects to Google Fit Sensors API.
    - You verify minimum heart rate elevation, step cadence, and GPS movement in real time.
    - You store the raw series (or compressed representation) server-side for audit.

This doesn’t fully eliminate manual editing, but it makes “after-the-fact” fabrication much harder, and you can programmatically flag outliers (e.g., perfectly round 10,000-step increments in one timestamp).[^1_7]

***

### 2.3 Fitbit \& WHOOP

**Fitbit:**

- The Fitbit Web API exposes daily and **intraday data** (per-minute or per-second) for activity and heart rate.[^1_8][^1_9]
- Access requires:
    - Registering a Fitbit app, OAuth2 user consent.
    - Separate **research/intraday approval** from Fitbit if you want fine-grained data (often granted for wellness/research contexts).[^1_8]
- Fitbit users can log workouts manually in the Fitbit app, but:
    - Device-collected intraday series (HR, steps) carry the imprint of real motion and heart-rate change.
    - You can treat **manually logged workouts with no matching HR/motion signal** as low-confidence and discount them.

**WHOOP:**

- WHOOP exposes an official **Developer Platform API** that allows third-party apps to pull recovery, strain, sleep summaries, etc.[^1_10][^1_11]
- The API mostly returns **summarized cycles** (sleep windows, strain scores) rather than raw continuous streams, but they are computed from the device’s sensors and cannot be manually edited by the user.[^1_11]

For both:

- Request **read-only OAuth scopes** for data; do not implement write scopes, so your app cannot alter the history at all.
- Treat these devices as **higher-trust sources** for certain habits (e.g., sleep consistency, HR-based workouts), and possibly **require** them for high-stakes “truth or money” challenges.

***

### 2.4 Cross-Cutting Pattern for Wearable Truth

Implementation pattern across platforms:

- **Mobile client:**
    - Native iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin) layers for HealthKit/Google Fit integrations; avoid cross-platform wrappers for this layer to keep full control over permissions and data types.
    - OAuth-based flows for Fitbit/WHOOP, then store tokens server-side.
- **Backend “Health Oracle” service:**
    - Periodically pulls data from:
        - iOS and Android devices (via background sync jobs).
        - Fitbit/WHOOP APIs (webhooks or scheduled pulls).
    - Applies rules:
        - Filter out manual entries (HealthKit metadata + bundle ID; Google Fit stream heuristics; Fitbit manual logs with no HR corroboration).
        - Enforce **time windows** relative to habit commitment.
        - Compute “proof scores” (confidence that the reported habit is genuine).
    - Writes normalized, append-only records into your main DB and a hash-chained “truth log” table for audit (each row includes hash of previous row + current payload).

You get a pragmatic “blockchain of truth” without distributed consensus or exotic hardware.

***

## 3. Financial APIs: Verifying Savings Without Move-Access

### 3.1 What You Actually Need From a Bank Integration

For “saved X dollars” habits, you do **not** need payment-rail permissions. You only need:

- **Read-only access** to:
    - Account identities and balances.
    - Transaction history for one or more accounts (especially inbound transfers into savings/goal accounts).
- A way to:
    - Confirm that, over a certain time window, the user’s **net position** in the targeted account increased by at least X.
    - Optionally confirm that funds came from specified sources (e.g., their own checking account).

This is exactly what Plaid’s **core data products** (Auth, Accounts, Transactions) are for; you do not touch Plaid Transfer or Ledger APIs that move money.[^1_12][^1_13]

***

### 3.2 Plaid: Read-Only Integration \& Permissions

**Security and scope:**

- Users authenticate via **Plaid Link**. You never see credentials; Plaid issues a **public token** to your front end, which you exchange server-side for an `access_token`.
- Your Plaid configuration defines which **products/scopes** you enable for your app, such as `transactions`, `accounts`, `identity`. You do not enable transfer/ledger/payment products.[^1_14][^1_12]
- Plaid’s access to each bank is also governed by OAuth/OIDC scopes; banks see exactly what data is being shared.[^1_15][^1_14]

**Technical tasks \& effort (rough)**

For a competent backend developer + mobile/web dev:

1. **Setup (1–2 days):**
    - Create Plaid account, sandbox keys.
    - Integrate Plaid Link in web/mobile front-end.
    - Implement `/plaid/link/token/create` and `/plaid/item/public_token/exchange` endpoints server-side.
2. **Data ingestion (3–7 days):**
    - Implement endpoints that call:
        - `/accounts/balance/get` for current balances.[^1_12]
        - `/transactions/sync` or `/transactions/get` for ledgers.
    - Normalize accounts and transactions into your DB.
    - Build an abstraction: “savings goal” → one or more (institution, account_id) pairs.
3. **Habit validation logic (3–5 days):**
    - For a “save \$X this month” habit:
        - At the start, snapshot the account’s balance and ledger position.
        - At the end, use Plaid again to:
            - Compare current balance vs baseline.
            - Count inbound transfers from allowed sources (checking, employer) during the window.
    - Define what counts as valid:
        - E.g., end balance ≥ baseline + X and no offsetting outbound transfers tagged “transfer” back to checking within a short window.[^1_12]
4. **Security \& compliance hygiene (ongoing, but initial 2–3 days):**
    - Store `access_token`s encrypted at rest.
    - Restrict internal access to financial tables.
    - Log all Plaid API calls and verification decisions to the tamper-evident log.

**Key point**: At no stage do you obtain the ability to move funds. That only occurs if you explicitly integrate products like Plaid Transfer or Plaid Ledger (which expose `/transfer/*` and `/transfer/ledger/*` endpoints for deposits/withdrawals). Simply never enable those.[^1_13]

***

### 3.3 Open-Source / Alternatives

There is **no mature, “drop-in” fully open-source equivalent to Plaid** for US-style aggregation at scale. What exists instead:

- **Commercial open banking APIs** (e.g., TrueLayer, Yapily, Finexer) that provide similar data aggregation functions, mostly in PSD2/FAPI markets.[^1_16][^1_17]
- **DIY connectors** to specific banks’ PSD2 APIs (more viable in EU/UK, far less uniform in US).

From a feasibility and cost standpoint:

- For a serious, money-staked consumer app, **Plaid (or a peer) is vastly lower risk and lower engineering cost** than maintaining a zoo of bank integrations.
- You can architect your system behind a **“BankDataProvider” interface**, initially backed by Plaid. If a compelling open-source aggregator emerges, you can swap the implementation later.

***

## 4. Video Validation \& Anonymous Peer Review

### 4.1 Storage \& Hosting Options and Costs

You have two major approaches:

**Option A — DIY: Object storage + your own encoding + CDN**

- Store originals and encoded renditions in **S3 / compatible object storage**:
    - S3 Standard: about **\$0.023/GB/month** for the first 50 TB.[^1_18]
    - Data egress: roughly **\$0.09/GB** for the first ~10 TB/month from AWS to the internet.[^1_18]
- Transcode with a background worker and `ffmpeg` to HLS (multiple bitrates).
- Serve via **CDN** (CloudFront, BunnyCDN, Cloudflare CDN). Bunny Storage + BunnyCDN is a very cheap combo: on the order of **\$0.01/GB/month** for storage; CDN bandwidth is pay-as-you-go and quite low.[^1_19][^1_20]

**Option B — Video platform as a service**

- **Cloudflare Stream**:
    - Bills on **minutes stored and minutes delivered**; encoding and bandwidth are bundled.[^1_21]
    - External analyses show effective pricing of about **\$0.01/GB/month storage** plus **\$1 per 1,000 minutes streamed**, which is very competitive for small-to-medium scale.[^1_22]
- **Mux Video**:
    - Separate per-minute pricing for input, storage, and delivery.
    - For example, first 5,000 minutes of on-demand video up to 1080p cost around **\$0.031–0.047/min for input**, **~\$0.0024–0.0036/min/month for storage**, **~\$0.008–0.01/min/month for delivery**, depending on tier and resolution.[^1_23]
    - Extremely developer-friendly and battle-tested, but can be pricier at scale.

**MVP recommendation:**

- For an early-stage, habit-tracking app, **Cloudflare Stream or Mux** often wins:
    - No need to run and secure your own encoding pipeline.
    - Predictable “minutes” pricing and baked-in CDN.
- As volumes grow, you can revisit whether DIY S3 + CDN is cheaper.

***

### 4.2 Basic Video Proof Workflow

1. **Client upload:**
    - Mobile app requests a signed upload URL (Stream/Mux direct upload, or S3 signed URL).
    - User records or selects video and uploads directly from device → storage/video provider.
2. **Backend ingest:**
    - Receives webhook or callback on video upload completion.
    - Extracts metadata (duration, resolution, timestamps).
    - Ties the video to:
        - A specific habit attempt instance.
        - The time window and any sensor/bank events.
3. **Encoding \& storage:**
    - If using Stream/Mux: provider handles encoding + multi-bitrate HLS→CDN.
    - If using S3: background worker (Node worker, or Lambda) runs `ffmpeg` to:
        - Generate HLS playlist + segments.
        - Store only the encoded HLS set for serving; archive original in cheap Glacier/Deep Archive (~\$0.0036 to \$0.00099/GB/month) for audit if needed.[^1_18]
4. **Playback:**
    - Your client gets a short-lived signed URL or playback token; peer reviewers cannot enumerate or exfiltrate the full library.

Place all raw video metadata and integrity hashes into your tamper-evident “truth log”.

***

### 4.3 Anonymous Peer-Review Routing System

Design goal: reviewers see *evidence* but do not learn real-world identity, and no single reviewer’s verdict is final.

**Data model:**

- `proofs` table: `id`, `user_id`, `habit_attempt_id`, `video_url_or_asset_id`, `status`, `submitted_at`.
- `reviews` table: `id`, `proof_id`, `reviewer_user_id`, `decision` (pass/fail/flag), `confidence`, `notes`, `created_at`.
- `review_assignments` table: `proof_id`, `reviewer_user_id`, `assigned_at`, `state`.

**Routing algorithm (service):**

- When a proof reaches “pending_review”:
    - Push a message to a queue/topic: `PROOF_SUBMITTED`.
    - Review routing worker:
        - Selects **N random eligible reviewers** (e.g., with reputation score, region filters).
        - Inserts assignments and enqueues `REVIEW_ASSIGNED` messages.

**Anonymous UX:**

- Client shows only:
    - Video (via provider’s player or `<video>` with signed URL).
    - Abstracted habit info (“30-minute run at 7–8 PM on Jan 10”) and possibly anonymized stats (city/timezone, but NOT name, avatar, or social graph).
- Reviewer returns a structured verdict:
    - Did this video plausibly show the claimed habit?
    - Did timestamps and basic context match the challenge?

**Microservice \& infrastructure pattern:**

- Use a **message queue** (e.g., AWS SQS, RabbitMQ, NATS) and fan-out patterns for decoupling submissions from reviews; AWS’s topic-queue-chaining pattern is well-suited for scaling review workers horizontally.[^1_24]
- Implement rate limits and abuse controls:
    - Limit how many reviews a single user can perform per hour/day.
    - Randomly inject “gold-standard” test items to score reviewers.
    - Maintain reviewer reputation and downweight or ban chronic outliers.

**Cost considerations:**

- Video costs will dominate once you have many daily users; review routing is mostly database + queue, which is cheap.
- Peer review load is bounded by `proofs_per_day × reviewers_per_proof`; you can tune reviewers_per_proof depending on stakes.

***

## 5. Tech Stack for a Real-Time, Financially Staked Leaderboard

### 5.1 Requirements

You need to support:

- **Real-time ranking**: “Who is leading this week’s challenge by verified steps/savings/etc.?”
- **Financial stakes**: Users lock funds; payouts are determined by “truth-evaluated” results.
- **High write rate** for events (sensor verifications, bank checks, video verdicts).
- **Low latency** for reads (leaderboard queries).

This maps very well to a **relational core** plus **Redis sorted-set leaderboards**.

Redis Sorted Sets are a standard solution for real-time leaderboards: each member (user or user+challenge) has an associated score, and updates and rank queries are $O(\log N)$, with excellent performance even at millions of entries.[^1_25]

***

### 5.2 Recommended, Cost-Effective Stack

**Frontend:**

- **React Native** mobile app (iOS \& Android) for habit UX, sensor permissions, and in-app video capture.
- Optional: **React** web app for admin dashboards and lightweight participant access.

**Backend (API \& services):**

- **Node.js + TypeScript**:
    - Use a structured framework: **NestJS** or similar for modular services.
    - REST or GraphQL API for the client; internal gRPC/REST for service-to-service calls if needed.
- Key services (can be separate code modules, not necessarily separate deployments initially):

1. **Auth \& Identity Service**
        - JWT-based auth.
        - Manages user identities, pseudonymous IDs used in peer review.
2. **Habit Engine Service**
        - Manages habit definitions, enrolments, schedules, stakes.
        - Emits events when a habit is started, completed, or evaluated.
3. **Verification Services**
        - **Health Oracle Service** (Section 2) for wearable data.
        - **Finance Oracle Service** (Section 3) for Plaid/open banking.
        - **Video Proof Service** for handling uploads/webhooks and linking proofs to attempts.
4. **Peer Review Service**
        - Handles review assignments, reviewer reputation, consensus logic.
5. **Ledger \& Payout Service**
        - Manages internal wallet balances, stakes, and payout rules.
        - Does **not** directly move money to/from banks; instead, it talks to Stripe/PayPal/etc. for deposits/withdrawals via separate flows.
6. **Leaderboard Service**
        - Wraps Redis sorted sets for challenge-specific scoreboards.

**Data stores:**

- **Primary DB**: PostgreSQL
    - Tables: users, accounts, habits, habit_attempts, stakes, transactions (internal), proofs, reviews, etc.
    - Use strict foreign keys and transactional integrity for financial movements.
- **Cache \& leaderboards**: Redis
    - One Sorted Set per leaderboard, e.g. `leaderboard:challenge:<id>`.
    - Update scores whenever a habit attempt is verified or a stake is resolved.[^1_25]
- **Object storage / video provider**:
    - MVP: **Cloudflare Stream** or **Mux** for simplicity.[^1_23][^1_21]
    - Alternative: S3/Bunny Storage + CDN when scale demands cost optimization.[^1_19][^1_18]

**Messaging \& background processing:**

- **Message queue**:
    - AWS SQS/SNS (if on AWS) or RabbitMQ (self-managed or cloud).
    - Use queue-based fan-out for:
        - Proof submission → review assignment.
        - Bank/health data pull jobs.
        - Leaderboard score recalculation.
- **Workers**:
    - Node.js workers via BullMQ / NestJS queues, or serverless functions (AWS Lambda) triggered by queue messages.

**Tamper-evident “truth log”:**

- In Postgres, maintain an `event_log` table:
    - Columns: `id`, `event_type`, `payload_json`, `previous_hash`, `current_hash`, `created_at`.
    - Each new event’s `current_hash` = hash(previous_hash || payload || timestamp).
- Periodically (e.g., daily), anchor the current head hash to a **public blockchain** via a tiny on-chain transaction if you want an external “timestamping oracle”. This can be deferred until later.

***

### 5.3 Deployment \& Cost Posture

- **Cloud provider**: AWS / GCP / DigitalOcean – any works; AWS gives you S3, RDS, Elasticache, SQS/SNS out of the box.
- For a lean early deployment:
    - 1–2 small application nodes (e.g., t3.small equivalents).
    - Managed Postgres (RDS / Cloud SQL) at a small instance tier.
    - Small Redis instance for cache/leaderboards.
    - Cloudflare Stream or Mux for video.
- Expected major cost drivers over time:
    - Video storage + delivery.
    - Plaid or equivalent per-user/month fees.
    - Database and Redis scaling as concurrent users rise.

The rest (API servers, background workers, queues) will likely be minor until you reach serious scale.

***

## 6. Putting It All Together

From a feasibility standpoint:

- **Wearable truth**: You can achieve strong, cross-platform, mostly-read-only integration with Apple HealthKit, Google Fit, Fitbit, and WHOOP by:
    - Requesting only read permissions.
    - Filtering by source/metadata (HealthKit), data stream identifiers \& raw sensors (Google Fit), and device-verified intraday data (Fitbit/WHOOP).[^1_4][^1_11][^1_5][^1_8][^1_2]
- **Financial truth**: Plaid (or similar) gives you exactly what you need—verified balances and transactions—without any ability to move money if you avoid transfer products and stick to read-only scopes.[^1_13][^1_15][^1_12]
- **Human truth (video + peers)**: Offloading encoding and delivery to Stream/Mux keeps infra costs and complexity reasonable. A simple queue-based assignment system gives you anonymous, redundant peer review with tunable strength.[^1_24][^1_21][^1_23]
- **Architecture \& stack**: A TypeScript/Node backend, Postgres, Redis sorted-set leaderboards, and message queues provide a clean, cheap, and well-understood foundation.[^1_25]

The combination gives you a **multi-oracle, tamper-evident, probabilistic “truth” system** without any custom hardware and without building a blockchain. The remaining work is mostly product design: defining clear rules for each habit, the confidence thresholds for verification, and the economics (stake sizes, payouts, and reviewer rewards) that make cheating irrational.
