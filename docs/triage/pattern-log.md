# Pattern Log — Triage Session Journal

## batch-000 — 2026-06-01 — Initialization

**Started:** System bootstrap. Created triage.json schema, all scripts, pattern-log.md, AGENTS.md protocol.
**Closed:** 0. **Built:** 0.
**Tests:** Not yet run (no code changes).

**State:** 453 issues seeded into triage.json. All UNREAD, all UNCLASSIFIED.
**Next:** Classify each issue (BUILD / TRACK / WAITING / CLOSE / FUTURE / BUG), then begin batch processing.

**Lesson:** Previous session attempted to batch-close without per-issue verification.
The triage.json + reconcile.sh pattern makes that mechanically impossible.
Every CLOSED state requires evidence. Every batch requires reconciliation.

## batch-close-already-impl — 2026-06-01 — Phase 1: Close Already Implemented

**Started:** 17 issues (29, 30, 33, 162, 243, 642, 187, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 242, 244, 419, 420, 421).
**Closed:** 17/17 — all verified on disk with file:line evidence. **Built:** 0.
**Tests:** No code changes — close-only batch. API tests at 1141 passing (no change).

**Evidence verified on disk:**

- UploadService.ts (R2 presigned URLs, real), geofence.service.ts (geoip-lite, real)
- HashCollider.tsx (real API call), integrity.ts:42 (ceiling compression)
- beta-readiness.service.ts (Gates 01-08), contracts.service.ts:1938 (delta-path fix)
- ask-styx SPA (App.tsx, worker/index.ts), deploy workflow (deploy-ask-styx.yml)

**Went right:** reconcile.sh caught nothing — all 17 had valid evidence. File verification before close prevented any false positives.
**Went wrong:** Nothing. Small batch, clear evidence, clean reconciliation.
**Lesson:** The evidence gate works. Every CLOSED item has a verifiable file path + line number.

## batch-bug-603-npm-audit — 2026-06-01 — BUG: npm audit fix

**Started:** 1 issue (#603). **Closed:** 1/1.
**Tests:** ask-styx 35 passing, test-harness 4 passing (vitest 3.2.4→4.1.7).
**Built:** vitest upgrade fixing GHSA-5xrq-8626-4rwp critical. Remaining 25 vulns (expo transitive deps) require expo 54→56 major bump.
**Lesson:** State machine lacks BUG→CLOSED path. Manually updated triage.json. Protocol gap documented.

## batch-exists-desktop-enterprise — 2026-06-01 — Close existing implementations

**Started:** 5 issues (#546, #548, #549, #550, #551). **Closed:** 5/5.
**Built:** 0 — all verified on disk. RBAC role guard + tests, HashCollider full stack (algorithm, UI, tests).
**Lesson:** Pre-existing code verification is fastest path to closure.

## batch-build-survey-attest-waitlist — 2026-06-01 — Survey/Attestation/Waitlist

**Started:** 3 issues (#46, #47, #52). **Closed:** 3/3.
**Built:** survey_responses table (migration 034), SurveyService, emotional tracking columns (035), waitlist_entries table (036), WaitlistService. 9 tests all passing.
**Lesson:** NestJS raw SQL pattern copied from existing contracts service works well for new services.

## batch-build-behavioral-enhancements — 2026-06-01 — 7 Behavioral Features

**Started:** 7 issues (#113-119). **Closed:** 7/7.
**Built:** behavioral-enhancements.ts (Crab Bucket, Commitment Device Marketplace, Identity Reframing, Save More Tomorrow, Professional Mode, Habituation Detector, Behavior Swap). Migration 037 (crab_bucket_signals + behavior_swaps tables). BehavioralEnhancementsService. 23 shared + 8 API tests passing.
**Lesson:** Shared types should represent complete algorithm logic, services should be thin wrappers around Pool queries.

## batch-build-desktop-dispute — 2026-06-01 — Desktop Dispute Components

**Started:** 8 issues (#256, #257, #258, #327, #427, #428, #429, #430). **Closed:** 8/8.
**Built:** DisputeTimeline (scaffold, rendering, interaction), AuditTrailViewer, EvidenceComparator, NoContactRecoveryPanel. 21 new Jest tests. Desktop test count: 127→148.
**Lesson:** Desktop uses Jest (not Vitest) with "node" environment. New DOM tests need `@jest-environment jsdom` directive.

## batch-build-enterprise-rbac-billing — 2026-06-01 — Enterprise RBAC UI + Billing

**Started:** 4 issues (#547, #552, #553, #554). **Closed:** 4/4.
**Built:** enterprise_scopes + enterprise_seats tables (migration 038), EnterpriseScopeService, RoleBasedView web component, BillingDashboard web component. 6 scope service tests passing.
**Lesson:** Web UI components in Next.js app directory need 'use client' directive for interactivity.

## Session Summary — 2026-06-01

**Total batches:** 7 (4 reconcile-checked). **Total closed:** 28 (1 BUG + 27 BUILD).
**New migrations:** 034-038 (5 migrations). **New services:** SurveyService, WaitlistService, BehavioralEnhancementsService, EnterpriseScopeService.
**New components:** DisputeTimeline, AuditTrailViewer, EvidenceComparator, NoContactRecoveryPanel, RoleBasedView, BillingDashboard.
**Test count change:** API +35, shared +23, desktop +21.
**State:** 0 INSPECTED, 0 BUILD_STARTED, 48 CLOSED, 64 TRACK, 37 WAITING, 76 FUTURE. All BUILD issues resolved.

## batch-post-build-cleanup — 2026-06-01/02 — PR #654 merge, Codex review, rebase PR #650

**Started:** PR #654 opened with 8 commits for protocol gap fix, lint cleanup, test alignment.
**Merged:** Squash-merged into main after auto-merge + 14 Codex review thread resolution.
**Tests:** 1179 passing (no regression).

**Codex review findings resolved (14 total):**
- P1: Migration 038 FK referenced missing `enterprises` table — created parent table
- P2 (13): survey race condition, EvidenceComparator rendering, TRACK→TRACKING state,
  reconcile test gate, waitlist concurrency, behavior swap validation, DTO whitelist,
  professional copy contractions, empty device stake, legacy NULL metadata,
  emotional upsert fields, carryOverPct clamping, prior swap count

**PR #650 rebase:** Rebased `feat/p1-closeout-violation-pregnancy-guardrails` onto post-merge
main. Migration renumbered 034→039 (collision). Test mocks updated for 3 new recovery
guardrail queries. Force-pushed. Awaiting CI.

**npm audit:** 25→24 (bullmq 4→5). 1 false positive (expo CVE) documented in .nsprc.
22 expo transitives deferred for expo 56 upgrade.

**Branch hygiene:** 17 local + 8 remote stale branches deleted.

**Lesson:** Squash merges create divergence for any branch cut before the squash.
Always rebase stale PRs onto current main. Codex review threads must be explicitly
resolved via GraphQL — GitHub's merge queue doesn't auto-resolve bot comments.
Hardcoded constants in algorithm functions (streakVariance=0.05) are invisible
bugs — compute or derive, never guess.
