## Phase I: Inventory

### Goals

- [x] Re-audit the prior local-dev-config commit as an adversarial hall monitor.
- [x] Verify no file-deletion/data-loss claim before pushing.
- [x] Make local-only closeout evidence remote-backed.
- [x] Check P0/P1 IRF state and record any discovered vacuum.
- [x] Commit, push, and open the product PR.

### Files Produced/Modified

| File                                                                                               | Action                                                                                                | Repo                                  | Tracked?    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `docs/planning/planning--hall-monitor-local-dev-config-closeout--2026-06-07.md`                    | Added closeout receipt                                                                                | `peer-audited--behavioral-blockchain` | Yes         |
| `docs/planning/session-exports/2026-06-07--peer-audited-local-dev-config-hall-monitor.md`          | Added session review export                                                                           | `peer-audited--behavioral-blockchain` | Yes         |
| `docs/planning/session-exports/2026-06-07--peer-audited-local-dev-config-hall-monitor--prompts.md` | Added explicit zero-prompt extractor note                                                             | `peer-audited--behavioral-blockchain` | Yes         |

---

## Phase II: Structural Triage

- [x] Git tracking: product files tracked and pushed on PR branch
- [x] File placement: product closeout evidence is under `docs/planning/`
- [x] Naming conventions: dated closeout/session-export names
- [x] Data integrity: no tracked product file deletions in `66e557fd`; no ignored session/conductor directories removed
- [x] Cross-references: IRF row resolves via `organvm irf status IRF-OPS-093`; GH issue `a-organvm/organvm-corpvs-testamentvm#429` exists
- [x] Version integrity: no destructive overwrite; corpvs remote had fresher IRF state and was left authoritative

## Phase III: Content Audit

| Deliverable    | Standard                              | Compliance                                                              | Gaps                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Product branch | Committed and pushed to origin        | `origin/codex/heal-local-dev-config` at `b6211b7e`                      | GitHub checks pending after PR open                                |
| Product PR     | Remote-visible integration path       | PR #669 opened                                                          | Not merged                                                         |
| Local tests    | Required gates pass                   | `make test`, `npm run lint`, Gate 04, diff-check, Prettier check passed | CI still pending                                                   |
| IRF update     | Parser-visible row and external issue | `IRF-OPS-093` resolves; GH#429 linked                                   | Systemic export fix remains open                                   |
| Session export | Remote-backed closeout artifact       | This review committed in product branch                                 | Prompt extraction emitted 0 prompts; noted in sibling prompts file |

## Phase IV: Lessons Extracted

1. A session-export file under a non-git workspace path is not preserved enough; the export destination must be checked, not assumed.
2. Late-file IRF rows can be invisible to `organvm irf status`; parser-visible placement with plain priority is required until IRF parser debt is fixed.
3. A branch pushed to origin is durable but not integrated; a PR is the visible integration path.
4. "Add-only" must be stated precisely: this work had no tracked file deletions, but it did intentionally modify existing source/config/docs.

---

## Phase V: Reconciliation

- [x] Structural issues fixed for this lane
- [x] Content gaps expanded into `IRF-OPS-093`
- [x] Session log written into tracked product docs
- [x] `derived-principles.md` not applicable; no new general principle beyond existing local:remote and N/A-vacuum rules
- [x] Fixes committed and pushed

---

## Outcome

**Summary:** Local-dev-config hardening was committed, re-verified, pushed, and opened as PR #669. The hall-monitor pass converted the non-git session-export persistence gap into a tracked product receipt plus remote-backed `IRF-OPS-093` / GH#429.
**Net quality delta:** Positive for this lane: source/config/runtime work is remote-backed, tests pass locally, the PR exists, and the discovered persistence vacuum is now tracked instead of hidden.
