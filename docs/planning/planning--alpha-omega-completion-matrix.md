# Alpha→Omega Architecture Completeness Matrix

**Purpose:** This document provides a comprehensive, peer-reviewable matrix of the entire Styx software architecture from Phase Alpha through Phase Omega. It explicitly isolates the **Beta-Ready** boundary for logic checks and go/no-go gating.

---

## Executive Logic Check: The Beta Boundary
For the Phase 1 Beta (Test-Money Pilot, iOS, No-Contact Recovery, US-only), the system requires strict gating. Items marked **[BETA-BLOCKER]** must be `IMPLEMENTED` for Beta to ship. Items marked **[TEST-MONEY]** or `[PILOT-EXCEPTION]` are closed-pilot allowances that must be re-opened before any public or real-money expansion. Items marked **[POST-BETA]** are explicitly deferred to later phases.

### Readiness Status Summary
*   **Alpha (Core Trust):** 100% Implemented
*   **Beta (Market-Safe Money Enablement):** Pilot-usable with caveats (geofence consistency and disclosed non-production identity controls remain open)
*   **Gamma (Proof Integrity):** Core backend implemented; public-scale proof authenticity remains incomplete
*   **Delta (Retention):** Backend recovery-partner flows exist, but end-user partner UX is incomplete
*   **Omega (Enterprise):** Not re-verified in this worksheet

## 2. Phase Beta: Market-Safe Money Enablement
*Objective: Close legal, operational, and financial blockers for the initial Pilot launch.*

| Feature ID | Component | Status | Beta Dependency | Logic / Review Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

## 🔍 Peer-Review Logic Checks

When reviewing this matrix, evaluate the following logical assertions:

1.  **Is Beta properly isolated?** 
    *   *Assertion:* By restricting Phase 1 to iOS, Test-Money, and No-Contact, we eliminate the need for `F-CORE-04` (Real-Money Settlement) and `F-AEGIS-05` (KYC) in the immediate launch, radically de-risking the MVP.
2.  **Is the Trust Layer complete?**
    *   *Assertion:* With `F-CORE-01` (Ledger), `F-CORE-02` (Truth Log), `F-FURY-01` (Router), and `F-FURY-05` (Honeypot) fully implemented, the backend can safely ingest and audit behavior without data corruption, even if the mobile client is using a synthetic camera (`F-MOBILE-01`).
3.  **Are the legal guardrails structurally sound?**
    *   *Assertion:* `F-AEGIS-03` (Age Gate) and `F-LEGAL-06` (Terminology CI Gate) provide automated, systemic protection against accidental regulatory violations (underage users or gambling terminology).
4.  **Is the "Shatter Point" protected?**
    *   *Assertion:* The primary vulnerability of peer-review is collusion. `F-FURY-05` (Honeypots) and `F-FURY-06` (Consensus) provide statistical protection, and `F-FURY-03` (Cross-Lobby Auditing) provides geographic/social isolation.

## Completed Peer-Review Worksheet (2026-03-10)

| Assertion | Verdict | Completed Review |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Beta properly isolated | `PARTIAL` | Restricting Phase 1 to iOS, Test-Money, and No-Contact does remove the immediate need for real-money settlement and vendor-backed KYC enforcement. However, the US-only boundary is weakened by split geofence implementations: the newer compliance path is fail-closed, while the legacy geofence service still treats non-US or unresolvable IPs as full-access. |
| 2. Trust layer complete | `QUALIFIED YES` | The ledger, truth log, Fury routing, consensus, honeypot grading, and pHash duplicate path are all real and test-backed. This is sufficient for a closed pilot's auditability and tamper evidence. It is not sufficient to claim production-grade proof authenticity, because the mobile camera path is explicitly synthetic and anomaly handling remains intentionally permissive for pilot throughput. |
| 3. Legal guardrails structurally sound | `PARTIAL` | The terminology CI gate and HttpOnly cookie auth are systemic controls. The age gate is materially weaker than the matrix originally claimed: the backend supports optional DOB validation, but the current mobile registration flow only sends a self-declared 18+ checkbox. That is acceptable only if the pilot continues to disclose that identity/age verification is non-production. |
| 4. "Shatter Point" protected | `QUALIFIED YES FOR CLOSED BETA` | Honeypots plus quorum consensus meaningfully raise the cost of collusion inside a small, invite-only cohort. The routing layer also excludes same-state, same-guild, same-enterprise, and accountability-partner reviewers. That said, the anti-collusion claim is still strongest for the closed pilot, not for broad public scale. |

## Findings

1. `High` — The geofence story is internally inconsistent. The matrix describes a US-only beta boundary, but one active implementation path still defaults non-US and unresolvable IPs to `TIER_1`, which undercuts the stated jurisdiction boundary.
2. `Medium` — The legal-guardrail narrative overstated the age gate. Current enforcement is self-declared in mobile plus optional DOB validation in API, not a strong automated runtime identity check.
3. `Medium` — `F-MOBILE-01` was labeled as a beta blocker while its own review note allowed synthetic capture for the pilot. The row now reflects that this is a closed-pilot exception rather than a public-scale-ready capability.
4. `Medium` — `F-SOCIAL-01` had a stale note. The feature is beyond "schema exists" or "verified end-to-end": the backend enforcement and lifecycle endpoints are present, but tester-visible partner workflow UX is still incomplete.
5. `Low` — The worksheet referenced `F-AEGIS-05` without a matching matrix row. That omission made the beta-scope argument harder to audit, so the row has been added.
