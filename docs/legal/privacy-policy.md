# Privacy Policy (Draft)

**STYX -- THE BLOCKCHAIN OF TRUTH**

_Last updated: 2026-03-08_
_Effective date: [TBD -- prior to beta launch]_

**IMPORTANT:** This is an internal draft for legal review. It is not a finalized, legally binding document. All provisions are subject to revision by qualified legal counsel before publication. Special attention is needed for CCPA compliance, health data handling, and AI processing disclosures.

---

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how [ORGANVM Entity TBD] ("Company", "we", "us") collects, uses, stores, and shares personal information through the Styx platform ("Platform"). Styx is a peer-audited behavioral contract platform where users stake financial deposits on habit commitments and peer auditors ("Furies") verify compliance.

Because Styx handles financial, behavioral, and potentially health-adjacent data, this policy is more detailed than a typical consumer app privacy policy. We take the sensitivity of this data seriously.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Account Information (PII)

Collected at registration and profile creation:

| Data Point | Purpose | Required |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Full legal name | Identity verification, 1099 issuance | Yes |
| Email address | Account access, notifications, communications | Yes |
| Password (hashed) | Authentication | Yes |
| Date of birth | Age verification (18+ requirement) | Yes |
| Phone number | Two-factor authentication, account recovery | Optional |
| Mailing address | 1099 issuance (Furies earning $600+/year) | Conditional |
| Profile photo | Account identification | Optional |

### 2.2 Financial Data

Processed through Stripe (we do not store raw payment credentials):

| Data Point | Purpose | Stored By |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| Credit/debit card details | Vault deposit funding | Stripe (PCI-DSS compliant) |
| Bank account details | Withdrawal processing | Stripe |
| Transaction history | Ledger integrity, dispute resolution | Styx (double-entry ledger) |
| Vault deposit amounts | Escrow management | Styx + Stripe FBO |
| Platform fee payments | Revenue accounting | Styx + Stripe |
| Fury bounty earnings | Bounty distribution, tax reporting | Styx + Stripe |

### 2.3 Behavioral and Health Data

Collected through Oath creation and proof submission:

| Data Point | Purpose | Sensitivity |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| Oath parameters (habit type, duration, frequency) | Contract management | Medium |
| Oath category (Biological, Recovery, etc.) | Feature routing, safety protocols | High |
| Proof photos | Fury audit verification | High |
| Proof submission timestamps | Verification window compliance | Medium |
| Completion/failure history | Integrity Score calculation | Medium |
| BMI data (biological oaths only) | Aegis Protocol safety validation | High |
| Weight targets (biological oaths only) | Aegis velocity cap enforcement | High |
| No-contact target identifiers (recovery oaths) | Recovery Protocol enforcement | Very High |
| Call/text log screenshots (recovery oaths) | No-contact verification | Very High |

**Special note on health data:** Styx is not a healthcare provider and does not claim HIPAA compliance. However, biological Oath data (BMI, weight targets) and recovery Oath data (behavioral patterns) are treated with health-data-level security controls. See Section 7 for retention and deletion.

### 2.4 Device and Technical Data

Collected automatically through Platform use:

| Data Point | Purpose | Source |
|------------|---------|--------|
| IP address | Geofencing (US-only), security | Server logs |
| Browser/device fingerprint | Fraud detection | Client-side |
| EXIF metadata from proof photos | Timestamp/location verification for Fury audits | Photo uploads |
| GPS coordinates (from EXIF) | Proof location verification | Photo uploads |
| Device type and OS | Compatibility, bug triage | Client-side |
| Session duration and navigation | UX analytics | Client-side |

**EXIF metadata disclosure:** When you upload a proof photo, we extract and store EXIF metadata including timestamp, GPS coordinates, camera model, and image dimensions. This metadata is shared with Fury auditors to verify proof authenticity. If you prefer not to share location data, you may disable GPS in your device camera settings, but Furies may consider location-free proofs less verifiable.

### 2.5 AI Processing Data

Data processed by third-party AI services:

| Feature | AI Provider | Data Sent | Data Retained by Provider |
|---------|-------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Grill Me (motivation challenge) | Google Gemini | Oath description, user prompt | Per Google's AI terms (transient) |
| ELI5 (explain terms) | Groq (Llama) | Contract parameters, user question | Per Groq's terms (not retained) |
| Proof pre-screening (future) | TBD | Proof photo, Oath criteria | TBD |

We do not send financial data, PII, or no-contact target identities to AI providers. AI prompts are constructed with anonymized context only.

_This draft requires review by qualified legal counsel specializing in consumer privacy, CCPA, and health data handling before publication. Particular attention needed for: (1) whether BMI/weight data triggers HIPAA-adjacent obligations, (2) EXIF/GPS data consent requirements by state, (3) AI processing disclosure adequacy under emerging AI regulation._
