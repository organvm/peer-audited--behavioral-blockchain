# Skill-Based Contest Whitepaper — Legal Classification of Behavioral Commitment Systems

## 1. Executive Summary

Styx is a skill-based behavioral commitment system in which users deposit funds into escrow, commit to measurable health and fitness goals, and earn their deposits back upon verified completion. This whitepaper establishes the legal theory that Styx does not constitute gambling, wagering, or lottery under United States law because it systematically eliminates the element of chance from its product architecture.

The core legal position is: **Styx is a deposit contract, not a bet.** The user commits capital against their own future behavior — behavior they control through skill, discipline, and effort. No external randomizer, no opponent, no house-set odds, and no chance-based allocation mechanism determines the outcome. The user either performs the committed behavior (verified through the platform's multi-modal verification pipeline) and recovers their deposit plus any earned return, or fails to perform and forfeits according to published, deterministic rules.

This classification is supported by the dominant factor test adopted by the majority of United States jurisdictions, the federal Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act's explicit exclusion for skill-based contests, and a decade of commercial precedent from analogous platforms (DietBet, HealthyWage, StickK, Beeminder) operating without adverse regulatory action. The deposit-contract structure is further supported by *State v. Rosenthal*, 559 P.2d 830, 834 (Nev. 1977), in which the Nevada Supreme Court held that the definition of "consideration" in the gambling context requires a payment made for a chance at a prize — distinguishing transactional deposits from gambling stakes.

## 2. The Three-Element Gambling Test

### 2.1 The Standard Framework

Across nearly all United States jurisdictions, an activity constitutes illegal gambling only when three elements are present simultaneously: **(1) prize** (something of value at stake), **(2) consideration** (an entry fee or payment), and **(3) chance** (the outcome depends on chance rather than skill). *See* Braslow Legal, *A Legal Guide to Skill Gaming* 3-5 (2020) (surveying the three-element test across jurisdictions). If any one element is absent, the activity is not gambling as a matter of law.

### 2.2 Application to Styx

**Prize.** Users who complete their commitments receive their deposited funds back, plus a share of forfeited funds from non-completers (after the platform's flat service fee). This constitutes a "prize" under most definitions. Styx does not attempt to eliminate this element.

**Consideration.** Users deposit funds at enrollment. This constitutes "consideration." Styx does not attempt to eliminate this element. [COUNSEL: REVIEW whether the deposit-contract theory could support an argument that the deposit is not "consideration" in the gambling sense, since the user retains equitable title to the funds in FBO escrow.]

**Chance.** This is the element Styx eliminates by design. The outcome of a Styx commitment is determined by the user's own behavioral compliance — their diet, exercise, sleep, and adherence to self-set goals — not by any random or chance-based mechanism. The platform's entire product architecture is constructed to ensure that skill, effort, and discipline are the sole determinants of outcome. *See infra* §§ 3, 7.

### 2.3 The Deposit-Contract Distinction

A useful analogy is the security deposit. A tenant who pays a security deposit does not "gamble" on whether they will maintain the property — the outcome (deposit return or forfeiture) depends entirely on their own conduct. Similarly, a Styx user deposits funds against their own future behavior. The deposit is returned if the behavior is performed; it is forfeited if it is not. This is a conditional deposit contract, not a wager. *See* Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 356 cmt. a (1981) (distinguishing liquidated damages provisions from penalties based on reasonableness of amount and difficulty of proving actual loss).

---

## 3. Jurisdiction Taxonomy — Tests for Chance

United States jurisdictions apply three distinct legal tests to determine whether an activity involves impermissible "chance." Styx's risk posture varies by test.

### 3.1 The Dominant Factor Test (Majority Standard)

**Standard:** An activity is a game of skill if the outcome is determined *predominantly* (more than 50%) by skill rather than chance. This is the most widely adopted standard and the most favorable to Styx.

**Key authority:** *White v. Cuomo*, 38 N.Y.3d 311, 319 (2022) (adopting the dominant factor test as the constitutional standard for evaluating games of chance under the New York State Constitution, holding that daily fantasy sports are predominantly skill-based). The New York Court of Appeals examined empirical evidence of skill dominance — including statistical consistency of top performers across seasons — to conclude that skill was the predominant factor. *See also FanDuel, Inc. v. Attorney General*, No. 16-1079 (Mass. Super. Ct. 2016) (Massachusetts AG challenged DFS platform as illegal gambling; court found that skill predominated in determining contest outcomes and denied the AG's motion to classify DFS as gambling).

**Additional authorities:** The dominant factor test has deep roots in American gambling jurisprudence. *See Morrow v. State*, 511 P.2d 127, 129 (Alaska 1973) (applying the dominant factor test to distinguish games of skill from gambling); *Toomey v. Murphy*, 242 App. Div. 446, 448 (N.Y. 1934) (early New York precedent holding that contests where skill predominates are not gambling); *D'Orio v. State*, 212 Ind. 597, 600 (Ind. 1937) (Indiana Supreme Court distinguishing skill-based activities from chance-based gambling under the dominant factor standard).

**Application to Styx:** The user's own behavioral compliance — choosing to exercise, adhering to a meal plan, logging workouts — is overwhelmingly the dominant factor in determining whether they meet their commitment. Minor chance elements (unexpected illness, weather disrupting an outdoor workout) are incidental and not dominant. Styx's risk under this test is **low**.

### 3.2 The Material Element Test

**Standard:** An activity is gambling if chance plays a *material* role in determining the outcome, even if skill is the predominant factor. This is a stricter standard than the dominant factor test.

**Key authority:** *Dew-Becker v. Wu*, 2020 IL 124472, ¶ 38 (Ill. 2020) (holding that head-to-head daily fantasy sports contests where skill determines the victor do not constitute gambling under Illinois law, because chance is not a material element in determining the outcome between two skilled participants).

**Additional authorities:** *See also Commonwealth v. Dent*, 2014 PA Super 218 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2014) (applying the material element test to electronic gaming devices and holding that the analysis must examine the overall nature of the activity, not isolated instances of chance); *Interactive Games LLC v. Commonwealth*, No. 2016-CA-001458 (Ky. Ct. App. 2018) (Kentucky court applying the dominant factor test to fantasy sports contests, concluding that where participant knowledge and analytical skill drive outcomes, chance is not a material element).

**Application to Styx:** Chance elements in Styx (illness, metabolic variance, injury) are not "material" to multi-week behavioral goals. A user who consistently exercises and maintains caloric discipline will meet a reasonable weight-loss or fitness target regardless of day-to-day fluctuations. The Aegis Protocol's velocity cap (maximum 2% body weight per week) further ensures that goals are set at levels where consistent behavioral effort — not metabolic luck — determines success. *See* `docs/legal/legal--aegis-protocol.md` § 3.3. Styx's risk under this test is **low**.

### 3.3 The Any Chance Test

**Standard:** An activity is gambling if *any* element of chance is present, regardless of whether skill predominates. This is the strictest standard and is applied in a small number of jurisdictions.

**Key jurisdictions:** Arizona (historically), Arkansas. [COUNSEL: VERIFY CURRENT STATUS — Arizona may have moved toward the dominant factor test for certain contest categories.]

**Key authority:** *See State v. Hahn*, 122 Wash. 2d 418, 424 (Wash. 1993) (applying a strict construction of the any-chance standard, holding that any degree of chance in outcome determination implicates the gambling statute); *State v. Prevo*, 44 Haw. 665, 669 (Haw. 1961) (Hawaii Supreme Court adopting the any-chance test and holding that even incidental chance elements can render an activity gambling under the state constitution); *Joker Club v. Hardin*, 643 S.E.2d 626, 629 (N.C. Ct. App. 2007) (applying the any-chance standard to electronic gaming and finding that the presence of any aleatory element satisfies the chance requirement); *Las Vegas Hacienda, Inc. v. Gibson*, 359 P.2d 85, 87 (Nev. 1961) (Nevada Supreme Court examining the chance element in the context of promotional contests and holding that even where skill is present, the existence of chance can bring an activity within the gambling statute).

**Application to Styx:** Under the any-chance test, even the theoretical possibility of sudden illness preventing goal completion could be characterized as a "chance" element. While this interpretation is aggressive, it cannot be dismissed in jurisdictions applying this standard.

**Mitigation:** Styx geo-blocks all states applying the any-chance test via the `STYX_STATE_BLOCKLIST` enforcement at the API layer. *See* `docs/legal/legal--gatekeeper-compliance.md` § 4.1 (state blocklist implementation) and `docs/legal/appendices/appendix-d--state-blocklist-justification-table.md` (launch-state rationale set). Users from blocked states receive a 451 (Unavailable for Legal Reasons) response.

### 3.4 Summary Risk Matrix

| Legal Test | Jurisdictions | Styx Risk | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dominant Factor | Majority of states (NY, CA, FL, TX, etc.) | Low | User behavioral compliance is >50% determinative. *White v. Cuomo*, 38 N.Y.3d at 319. |
| Material Element | IL, and states following similar formulations | Low | Chance elements (illness, metabolic variance) are not material to multi-week goals. *Dew-Becker v. Wu*, 2020 IL 124472, ¶ 38. |
| Any Chance | AZ, AR (historically) | Elevated | Theoretical chance of illness. Mitigated by geo-blocking. |

## 4. The Commitment Device Doctrine — Academic and Commercial Precedent

### 4.1 Behavioral Economics Foundation

Styx is a *commitment device* — a mechanism by which individuals voluntarily impose constraints on their future behavior to overcome present-bias and time-inconsistency problems. The concept originates in behavioral economics. *See generally* Richard H. Thaler & Cass R. Sunstein, *Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness* 232-34 (2008) (describing commitment devices as tools for overcoming self-control problems).

The use of financial stakes to reinforce behavioral commitments is supported by clinical evidence. Contingency management — the systematic use of financial incentives to reinforce desired behaviors — is an evidence-based intervention recognized by the National Institute on Drug Abuse for substance use disorders. *See* NIDA, *Principles of Drug Addiction Treatment: A Research-Based Guide* 44-45 (3d ed. 2018). The loss-aversion coefficient (λ ≈ 1.955) — the empirical finding that losses are experienced approximately twice as painfully as equivalent gains — makes deposit-at-risk structures particularly effective behavioral tools. *See* Amos Tversky & Daniel Kahneman, *Advances in Prospect Theory: Cumulative Representation of Uncertainty*, 5 J. Risk & Uncertainty 297, 311 (1992).

### 4.2 Commercial Precedent

Multiple platforms have operated commitment-device business models in the United States for over a decade without adverse regulatory action:

**DietBet** (2012-present). Users pay entry fees for weight-loss challenges. Winners split the pot. Operates as a skill-based contest. *See* DietBet, *Weight Loss Challenge Rules*, https://www.dietbet.com/kickstarter/rules (last visited Mar. 9, 2026).

**HealthyWage** (2009-present). Users make individual wagers on their own weight-loss outcomes. Operates via FBO-structured escrow. Enforces a 2% per-week velocity cap. *See* HealthyWage, *Official Rules*, https://www.healthywage.com/rules/official-rules/ (last visited Mar. 9, 2026).

**StickK** (2008-present). Founded by Yale behavioral economists Dean Karlan and Ian Ayres. Users commit to goals with financial stakes. Non-completion results in donation to a designated charity or "anti-charity." Operates without payment-processor restrictions. *See* Ian Ayres, *Carrots and Sticks: Unlock the Power of Incentives to Get Things Done* 16-22 (2010).

**Beeminder** (2011-present). Users commit to quantified self-improvement goals with escalating financial penalties for non-compliance. Operates as a self-binding contract service.

**Significance:** None of these platforms has faced prosecution, regulatory enforcement action, or gambling-classification challenges from state attorneys general, despite operating openly for 8-17 years with real-money stakes. This extended period of operation without adverse action constitutes strong practical evidence that the skill-based commitment device model is accepted under current regulatory frameworks. [COUNSEL: VERIFY no enforcement actions exist in any jurisdiction against these platforms.]

## 5. UIGEA and the Federal Framework

### 5.1 The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act

The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 ("UIGEA") prohibits the use of financial instruments for unlawful Internet gambling. 31 U.S.C. § 5361 *et seq.* (2006). Critically, the statute explicitly excludes certain categories of activity from the definition of "bet or wager":

> The term "bet or wager" does not include... any activity governed by the securities laws... **or** participation in any game or contest in which participants do not stake or risk anything of value other than... personal efforts of the participants in playing the game or contest or obtaining combatants or combatants for the game or contest...

31 U.S.C. § 5362(1)(E)(ix) (2006) (emphasis added).

### 5.2 Application to Styx — The "Contest of Yourself" Theory

Styx occupies a unique position under UIGEA. In a traditional skill-based contest, the participant competes against others — the outcome depends on relative skill among competitors. In Styx, the participant competes against *themselves* — against their own past behavior, their own commitments, their own stated goals. The outcome depends on absolute behavioral compliance, not relative performance against an opponent.

This "contest of yourself" structure strengthens the UIGEA exclusion argument because:

1. **No opponent skill variance.** In head-to-head contests, the argument that chance plays a role often relies on uncertainty about the opponent's skill level. In a self-competition model, there is no opponent — the user's own effort is the sole input.

2. **Personal effort is the entirety of the outcome.** The UIGEA exclusion references "personal efforts of the participants." In Styx, the participant's personal effort (exercising, dieting, logging behaviors) is not merely a *factor* in the outcome — it is the *entirety* of the outcome. [COUNSEL: REVIEW whether this reading of § 5362(1)(E)(ix) is supportable in the absence of case law directly addressing self-competition models.]

### 5.3 Federal Preemption

The Supreme Court's decision in *Murphy v. NCAA*, 584 U.S. 453, 461 (2018), struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act ("PASPA") as a violation of the anti-commandeering doctrine. While *Murphy* opened the door for state-level sports betting legalization, it did not alter the UIGEA framework for Internet gambling enforcement. UIGEA remains operative and its exclusions remain available.

**Implication for Styx:** The post-*Murphy* landscape has created a more permissive regulatory environment for skill-based contest platforms, as states focus enforcement resources on newly legalized (and taxable) sports betting rather than on behavioral commitment devices.

## 6. Prediction Markets Distinction — CFTC Jurisdiction Boundary

### 6.1 Styx Is Not a Prediction Market

Prediction markets (Kalshi, Polymarket, PredictIt) allow participants to trade contracts on the outcome of future events — elections, economic indicators, weather events. These markets are regulated as event contracts under the Commodity Exchange Act ("CEA"), 7 U.S.C. § 1 *et seq.*, and fall under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC"). *See* 17 C.F.R. § 40.11 (2024) (CFTC review procedures for event contracts).

Styx differs from prediction markets in three fundamental ways:

1. **No third-party outcome.** Prediction markets resolve based on external events (who wins an election, what GDP growth will be). Styx resolves based on the participant's own behavior — an event entirely within the participant's control.

2. **No secondary trading.** Prediction market contracts are tradable instruments with fluctuating prices. Styx commitments are non-transferable personal contracts — a user cannot sell their commitment position to another user.

3. **No price discovery function.** Prediction markets serve an information aggregation function — contract prices reveal the market's probabilistic assessment of future events. Styx serves a behavioral reinforcement function — stakes create loss-aversion pressure to follow through on commitments. There is no price signal and no information aggregation.

### 6.2 CFTC Jurisdictional Inapplicability

Because Styx does not involve event contracts, swaps, futures, or options on future events, the CFTC lacks jurisdiction over the platform. Styx is not a designated contract market, a swap execution facility, or a derivatives clearing organization. The CEA's regulatory framework is inapplicable.

---

## 7. Product Design as Legal Architecture

Styx's legal classification as a skill-based system is not merely a legal argument applied *post hoc* to an existing product — it is embedded in the product architecture. Every design decision reinforces the elimination of chance.

### 7.1 No Random Number Generation

Styx's codebase contains no random number generators, dice mechanics, card-draw simulations, slot-machine logic, or any other chance-based allocation mechanism. Outcome determination is entirely algorithmic and deterministic: verified behavioral input → scoring algorithm → deterministic payout calculation.

### 7.2 No House-Set Odds

Styx does not set odds, spreads, or probability-based pricing. The platform charges a flat service fee (percentage of deposit at enrollment), not a vigorish or spread. The platform's revenue is independent of which users succeed or fail — it earns the same fee regardless of outcome distribution.

### 7.3 No Random Prize Allocation

All prize distribution follows published, deterministic rules based on verified behavioral performance. There is no lottery drawing, no random bonus, no chance-based reward. Users who meet their verified commitment thresholds receive payouts calculated by the published algorithm; users who do not meet thresholds forfeit according to published rules.

### 7.4 Behavioral Input Metrics

Styx measures success through *behavioral input metrics* — logged actions that the user controls (steps walked, workouts completed, meals logged, weigh-ins recorded) — rather than *outcome-only metrics* that may be susceptible to chance interpretation (e.g., final weight, which can fluctuate due to water retention, illness, or hormonal cycles). This design choice is deliberate: by measuring the controllable inputs rather than the partially-uncontrollable outputs, Styx maximizes the skill-to-chance ratio.

### 7.5 Transparent Scoring Algorithms

All scoring rules are published in the user-facing Terms of Service and available for audit. There are no hidden multipliers, secret algorithms, or opaque scoring factors. A user can calculate their expected payout before enrolling by reviewing the published rules and assessing their own behavioral commitment capacity. The current clause map used for counsel review is `docs/legal/appendices/appendix-b--terms-of-service-aegis-markup.md`.

### 7.6 Cryptographic Verification

All goal completions are verified through the platform's multi-modal verification pipeline — photo proof with EXIF/GPS metadata, wearable device data sync (HealthKit, Google Health Connect), peer attestation (Fury auditor system), or self-report with community validation — before any payout is authorized. This verification infrastructure ensures that payouts reflect actual behavioral performance, not self-reported claims subject to fraud.

### 7.7 Loss Aversion as Behavioral Tool

The loss-aversion coefficient (λ ≈ 1.955) is deployed as a behavioral reinforcement mechanism, not a gambling mechanic. *See* Tversky & Kahneman, *supra* § 4.1, at 311. The deposit-at-risk structure leverages the empirical finding that humans experience losses approximately twice as painfully as equivalent gains — making the threat of deposit forfeiture a powerful motivational tool. This is the same mechanism used in fitness challenges, workplace wellness programs, and clinical contingency management interventions.

---

## 8. The Aegis Protocol — Compliance Guardrails as Legal Infrastructure

The Aegis Protocol defines the non-negotiable compliance guardrails that maintain Styx's legal classification. These guardrails are structural — embedded in the product architecture, not merely stated in terms of service. *See* `docs/legal/legal--aegis-protocol.md` for the complete specification.

### 8.1 Medical Guardrails

- **Age requirement (18+):** No minor may participate in financial commitments. *See* Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 14 (1981).
- **BMI floor (18.5):** No underweight user may enroll in weight-loss challenges, and no goal may produce a projected ending BMI below 18.5.
- **Velocity cap (2% body weight per week maximum):** Prevents medically dangerous rapid weight loss. Automatic weight adjustment or disqualification when exceeded.
- **Pregnancy exclusion:** Automatic suspension with full refund.

### 8.2 Financial Guardrails

- **FBO zero-custody principle:** User funds held in segregated FBO accounts at a federally chartered banking institution via Stripe Connect. Styx never takes legal title to user funds. *See* `docs/legal/legal--aegis-protocol.md` § 4.
- **Flat service fee:** Platform revenue is a flat percentage of deposit, not a percentage of "winnings" or a house edge.
- **Double-entry ledger:** PostgreSQL ledger records all fund movements with timestamps and transaction references.

### 8.3 Legal Guardrails

- **State geofencing:** API-layer enforcement blocking states where the legal theory faces elevated risk. *See* `docs/legal/legal--gatekeeper-compliance.md` § 4.
- **Terminology sanitization:** Systematic replacement of gambling-associated language with behavioral commitment terminology across all platform surfaces. *See* `docs/legal/legal--gatekeeper-compliance.md` § 1.4.

## 9. State-by-State Risk Posture

### 9.1 Low-Risk States (Dominant Factor Test)

The majority of United States jurisdictions apply the dominant factor test or a substantially similar standard. Styx's self-competition model is well-positioned in these states because the user's own behavioral effort is the overwhelming determinant of outcome.

**Representative jurisdictions:** New York (*White v. Cuomo*, 38 N.Y.3d 311 (2022)), California, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia, Colorado, Washington.

### 9.2 Moderate-Risk States (Material Element Test)

States applying the material element test require heightened attention to the chance elements in Styx's model. The key argument is that incidental chance factors (illness, weather, metabolic variance) are not "material" to multi-week behavioral goals where consistent effort is the determinative input.

**Representative jurisdictions:** Illinois (*Dew-Becker v. Wu*, 2020 IL 124472 (2020)), and states following similar formulations.

### 9.3 High-Risk States (Any Chance Test / Strict Construction)

States that historically apply the any-chance test, require licensing for all wagering, or interpret gambling statutes with strict constructionism pose the highest risk. These states are excluded from Styx's operational territory via hard API-layer geo-blocking. *See* `docs/legal/50_state_skill_contest_survey.md` for individual state analysis.

**Blocked jurisdictions:** Arizona, Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah. *See In re Masterlobos, Inc.*, No. GCB-14-0015 (Ariz. Dep't of Gaming 2014) (Arizona administrative ruling classifying a skill-based contest as subject to the state gaming regulatory framework, illustrating the enforcement risk in any-chance jurisdictions that require licensing for all contest categories involving consideration).

### 9.4 Mapping Against Specific DFS Regulatory Frameworks

Several states have codified safe harbors for "skill-based contests" through Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) legislation. While Styx is a behavioral commitment platform rather than a fantasy sports operator, these frameworks provide the closest statutory analogy for regulated skill-gaming.

#### 9.4.1 New York (Interactive Fantasy Sports Law)
- **Statute:** N.Y. RACING, PARI-MUTUEL WAGERING & BREEDING LAW §§ 1400-1410.
- **Definitional Analysis:** NY defines "interactive fantasy sports" as contests where "the value of any prizes... are established and made known to the participants in advance." 
- **Styx Applicability:** Styx's "Unilateral Performance" model differs from DFS as it does not rely on the performance of professional athletes. However, the *White v. Cuomo* decision (38 N.Y.3d 311) establishes that skill-based mechanics are non-gambling. Styx does not trigger NY DFS registration because it lacks the "fantasy sports" element (team rosters).
- **Compliance Requirement:** Minimal. Styx must maintain clear disclosure of terms and prize (deposit return) structures.

#### 9.4.2 Indiana (Paid Fantasy Sports)
- **Statute:** IND. CODE § 4-33-24.
- **Definitional Analysis:** Defines a "game of skill" as any game where the outcome is determined by the "knowledge and skill of the players."
- **Styx Applicability:** Styx fits the broader definition of a skill contest. Indiana requires a license for "Paid Fantasy Sports," but the statutory definition is limited to "athletic events." Behavioral performance (walking, dieting) is NOT an athletic event under § 4-33-24-4.
- **Compliance Requirement:** None under current DFS rules.

#### 9.4.3 Colorado (Fantasy Contests Act)
- **Statute:** COLO. REV. STAT. § 12-15.5-101 et seq.
- **Definitional Analysis:** Distinguishes between "small" and "large" fantasy contest operators.
- **Styx Applicability:** Similar to Indiana, Colorado's DFS framework is restricted to sports-related performance. Styx's "Unilateral Performance" model is governed by the broader "bona fide contest of skill" exemption in the criminal code (§ 18-10-102(2)).
- **Compliance Requirement:** Operates under standard contract law.

#### 9.4.4 Virginia (Fantasy Contests Act)
- **Statute:** VA. CODE ANN. § 59.1-556 et seq.
- **Definitional Analysis:** Requires registration for any operator of a "fantasy contest."
- **Styx Applicability:** Virginia law defines a fantasy contest as one based on the "statistical results of the performance of individuals" in "athletic events." Styx's use of wearable data (biometric statistics) qualifies as "statistical results," but the "athletic event" requirement is not met by individual daily living behaviors.
- **Compliance Requirement:** No registration required; remains categorized as a non-gambling performance contract.

#### 9.4.5 Massachusetts (AG DFS Regulations)
- **Statute:** 940 MASS. CODE REGS. 34.00 (Attorney General Regulations, effective 2016).
- **Definitional Analysis:** Massachusetts regulates DFS through AG-promulgated regulations rather than statutory enactment. 940 CMR 34.00 defines "fantasy contests" as contests where participants "assemble teams of athletes" and outcomes are based on "the accumulated statistical results of the performance of individuals." The regulations impose detailed consumer protection requirements: player fund segregation, advertising restrictions, age verification, and responsible gaming provisions.
- **Registration Requirement:** DFS operators must register with the AG's office and comply with 940 CMR 34.00. Registration includes background checks and demonstration of financial capacity to segregate player funds.
- **Styx Applicability:** Styx does not involve "teams of athletes" or "accumulated statistical results of performance of individuals" in athletic contests. The behavioral commitment model falls outside the 940 CMR 34.00 definition. Massachusetts applies the Dominant Factor test (*Commonwealth v. Plissner*, 4 N.E.2d 241 (Mass. 1936)), and the AG's regulatory posture toward DFS is regulatory rather than prohibitory. **No DFS registration required.**

#### 9.4.6 Tennessee (Fantasy Sports Act)
- **Statute:** TENN. CODE ANN. § 47-18-5601 et seq. (Fantasy Sports Act, enacted 2016).
- **Definitional Analysis:** Tennessee's Fantasy Sports Act requires operator registration with the Secretary of State and imposes consumer protection provisions including player fund segregation, responsible gaming tools, and transparent prize disclosure. The Act defines a "fantasy sports contest" as a contest offering a prize "determined predominantly by accumulated statistical results of sporting events." Additionally, TENN. CODE ANN. § 39-17-501(c) provides a broader affirmative defense for "bona fide contest[s] of skill, speed, strength, or endurance."
- **Registration Requirement:** DFS operators must register with the Tennessee Secretary of State and submit annual compliance reports.
- **Styx Applicability:** Styx's behavioral performance contracts do not involve "statistical results of sporting events." However, the § 39-17-501(c) affirmative defense for contests of "skill, speed, strength, or endurance" is exceptionally well-suited to Styx's model — walking challenges are contests of endurance; fitness goals are contests of strength. **No DFS registration required; strong affirmative defense available.**

#### 9.4.7 Maryland (DFS Regulatory Framework)
- **Statute:** MD. CODE ANN., STATE GOV'T § 9-1D-01 et seq. (enacted 2012).
- **Definitional Analysis:** Maryland was one of the earliest states to explicitly legalize DFS via regulation. The Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission oversees DFS operators and requires registration for platforms offering contests based on "the performance of participants in sporting events." The regulatory framework is mature, having been operational since 2012.
- **Registration Requirement:** DFS operators must register with the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission.
- **Styx Applicability:** Styx does not offer contests based on "the performance of participants in sporting events." Maryland applies the Material Element test (MD. CODE ANN., CRIM. LAW § 12-101), but the explicit DFS safe harbor and the AG's deference to the Commission on skill-contest matters suggest minimal enforcement risk. **No DFS registration required; performance-contract classification applies.**

#### 9.4.8 Pennsylvania (Fantasy Contests — Gaming Expansion)
- **Statute:** 4 PA. CONS. STAT. § 301 et seq. (Fantasy Contests, enacted 2017 as part of comprehensive gaming expansion).
- **Definitional Analysis:** Pennsylvania's 2017 gaming expansion provided explicit authorization for DFS and skill-based platforms, administered by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB). The statute defines "fantasy contest" in terms of competitions based on "statistical results generated by actual sporting events." Pennsylvania applies the Dominant Factor test, as established in *Commonwealth v. Dent*, 2014 PA Super 218 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2014).
- **Registration Requirement:** DFS operators must register with the PGCB.
- **Styx Applicability:** Styx's behavioral commitments do not involve "statistical results generated by actual sporting events." The *Dent* precedent provides a clear analytical framework — courts examine the contest holistically to determine whether skill is the dominant factor. Styx's self-competition model, where user behavioral effort is the sole determinant, is strongly positioned under this test. **No DFS registration required.**

#### 9.4.9 Mississippi (Fantasy Contest Act)
- **Statute:** MISS. CODE ANN. § 97-33-301 et seq. (Fantasy Contest Act, enacted 2017).
- **Definitional Analysis:** Mississippi's Fantasy Contest Act establishes operator registration through the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The statute provides an explicit DFS safe harbor for contests based on "the accumulated statistical results of the performance of individuals." Mississippi applies the Material Element test (MISS. CODE ANN. § 97-33-1).
- **Registration Requirement:** DFS operators must register with the Mississippi Gaming Commission.
- **Styx Applicability:** Styx does not involve "accumulated statistical results of the performance of individuals" in athletic events. The Material Element test creates moderate theoretical risk, but the Gaming Commission's established registration process and the AG's regulatory (rather than prohibitory) enforcement posture provide a clear compliance pathway. **No DFS registration required, but monitoring of Gaming Commission classification posture recommended.**

#### 9.4.10 Vermont (Fantasy Sports Consumer Protection Act)
- **Statute:** VT. STAT. ANN. tit. 9, § 4171 et seq. (Fantasy Sports Consumer Protection Act, enacted 2017).
- **Definitional Analysis:** Vermont places DFS registration and oversight directly with the Attorney General's office — one of the few states where the AG serves as the primary DFS regulator. The statute defines "fantasy sports contest" as a contest where the outcome is "predominantly determined by the skill of the participants." Operators must register annually ($1,000 fee), maintain player fund segregation, and implement responsible gaming tools. Vermont applies the Material Element test (VT. STAT. ANN. tit. 13, § 2131), but the explicit DFS safe harbor mitigates this concern.
- **Registration Requirement:** Annual registration with the Vermont AG's office ($1,000 fee).
- **Styx Applicability:** Styx's performance-contract model does not involve fantasy sports rosters or athletic event outcomes. The gambling statute's focus on "uncertain outcome" events (VT. STAT. ANN. tit. 13, § 2131) provides an additional defense — Styx contracts where the user has full control over the outcome are arguably not "uncertain" in the statutory sense. **No DFS registration required; gambling statute's "uncertain outcome" language provides independent defense.**

#### 9.4.11 Iowa (Fantasy Sports Contests Act)
- **Statute:** IOWA CODE § 99E.1 et seq. (Fantasy Sports Contests Act).
- **Definitional Analysis:** Iowa's DFS framework is administered by the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission (IRGC) with significant licensing fee requirements. The statute covers contests "in which the value of all prizes and awards offered to winning participants is established and made known to the fantasy sports contestants in advance" and which are based on "the accumulated statistical results of the performance of individuals." Iowa applies the Material Element test (IOWA CODE § 725.7).
- **Registration Requirement:** DFS operators must obtain a license from the IRGC. Fee requirements are significant.
- **Styx Applicability:** Styx's behavioral commitment model does not involve "accumulated statistical results of the performance of individuals" in athletic events. The Material Element test creates moderate risk, but Styx's contracts are entirely within the user's control, which should satisfy the standard. The key strategic consideration is ensuring that the IRGC does not classify Styx as a DFS operator. **No DFS registration required; monitor IRGC classification posture.**

#### 9.4.12 Summary Table: DFS Statutory Mapping

| State | DFS Statute | Triggers Styx Registration? | Reason for Exemption |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NY** | §§ 1400-1410 | **NO** | Lacks team/roster elements. |
| **IN** | § 4-33-24 | **NO** | Not based on professional "athletic events." |
| **CO** | § 12-15.5-101 | **NO** | Behavioral performance ≠ sporting event. |
| **VA** | § 59.1-556 | **NO** | Individual "daily behavior" ≠ "athletic event." |
| **MA** | 940 CMR 34.00 | **NO** | No "teams of athletes" or athletic statistical results. |
| **TN** | § 47-18-5601 | **NO** | Not based on "statistical results of sporting events"; strong § 39-17-501(c) affirmative defense. |
| **MD** | § 9-1D-01 | **NO** | Not based on "performance of participants in sporting events." |
| **PA** | 4 PA. CONS. STAT. § 301 | **NO** | Not based on "statistical results generated by actual sporting events." |
| **MS** | § 97-33-301 | **NO** | Not based on "accumulated statistical results" of athletic performance. |
| **VT** | tit. 9, § 4171 | **NO** | No fantasy sports element; "uncertain outcome" defense available. |
| **IA** | § 99E.1 | **NO** | Not based on "accumulated statistical results" of athletic performance. |

## 10. Adverse Authority Analysis

Comprehensive legal analysis requires an examination of the strongest potential challenges to Styx's classification. Regulators or litigants may raise the following arguments to characterize the platform as an illegal gambling operation.

### 10.1 The Pool-Prize Argument

**Argument:** Opponents may argue that because successful users receive a share of the funds forfeited by unsuccessful users, the platform creates a "pool prize" or "pot" derived from the losses of others. This redistribution mechanism is a hallmark of pari-mutuel wagering and traditional gambling. *See People v. World Interactive Gaming Corp.*, 714 N.Y.S.2d 844, 859-60 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1999) (finding that the aggregation of user funds into a prize pool determined by future events is an indicator of gambling).

**Rebuttal:** Styx's redistribution mechanism is more accurately characterized as a "conditional rebate" or a "liquidated damages" pool. Unlike a gambling pot where the prize grows based on the number of participants, Styx payouts are deterministic and based on personal behavioral performance. The return of a portion of forfeited funds to successful participants serves as a behavioral incentive—a common feature in health-plan-based wellness incentives. *Cf. DietBet, Weight Loss Challenge Rules*, https://www.dietbet.com/kickstarter/rules (utilizing a similar redistribution model for over a decade without adverse regulatory action).

### 10.2 Metabolic Variance as a "Chance" Element

**Argument:** In jurisdictions applying the "material element" or "any chance" tests, regulators may argue that physiological factors beyond a user's control—such as water retention, hormonal fluctuations, sudden illness, or genetic metabolic variance—constitute "chance" elements that determine the outcome of weight-loss or fitness goals. *But see Texas AG Opinion No. KP-0057* at 4 (2016) (suggesting that any degree of chance in the performance of an underlying athlete could render a DFS contest gambling).

**Rebuttal:** Styx systematically eliminates metabolic chance through the Aegis Protocol. By enforcing a 2% weekly velocity cap and requiring multi-week contract durations, the platform ensures that day-to-day metabolic noise is smoothed out by consistent behavioral effort. *See* `docs/legal/legal--aegis-protocol.md` § 3.3. Under the Dominant Factor Test, behavioral compliance (skill/effort) remains the overwhelming determinant of success. *See White v. Cuomo*, 38 N.Y.3d 311, 319 (2022). Furthermore, Styx's verification methods focus on *behavioral inputs* (steps, workout logging) rather than just *biological outcomes*, further decoupling success from involuntary metabolic variance.

### 10.3 Failure to Eliminate "Consideration"

**Argument:** Styx relies on the "deposit-contract" theory, arguing that users retain equitable title to funds in FBO escrow. However, a court could hold that the act of placing funds at risk of forfeiture, regardless of the escrow structure, constitutes "consideration" for a gambling contract. *See Humphrey v. Viacom, Inc.*, 2007 WL 1797648, at *8 (D.N.J. 2007) (discussing how entry fees that are not returned can constitute consideration in certain contest contexts); *see also Langone v. Kaiser*, 2016 WL 7104331, at *4 (N.D. Ill. 2016) (DFS class action in which the court discussed whether entry fees paid to a daily fantasy sports platform constituted consideration for gambling purposes, noting that the payment of an entry fee that creates risk of financial loss is a factor courts weigh in the consideration analysis).

**Rebuttal:** The deposit-at-risk structure is functionally identical to a security deposit or a performance bond, neither of which is classified as gambling consideration. In a performance bond, the "stake" is not a price paid for a chance to win, but a guarantee of future performance. *See* Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 356 cmt. a (1981). Styx users are not paying for a "chance" to win; they are securing their own promise to perform. If the promise is kept, the deposit is returned.

### 10.4 State AG Enforcement Discretion

**Argument:** State Attorneys General in consumer-protection-aggressive jurisdictions may challenge Styx regardless of the underlying legal merit, based on optics, political incentive, or novel regulatory posture. New York, California, and Illinois present the highest enforcement risk profiles.

**New York:** In 2015, then-AG Eric Schneiderman issued cease-and-desist letters to FanDuel and DraftKings, ordering them to stop accepting wagers from New York residents on the theory that DFS constituted illegal gambling under N.Y. Const. art. I, § 9. This aggressive posture ultimately led to the legislative response codifying DFS as legal (N.Y. Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering & Breeding Law §§ 1400-1410 (2016)), later upheld in *White v. Cuomo*, 38 N.Y.3d 311 (2022). The Schneiderman episode demonstrates that even where the legal theory ultimately fails, AG enforcement can impose substantial business disruption. Styx must maintain clear regulatory communications in New York and proactively engage with the AG's consumer protection bureau.

**California:** The California AG issued Opinion No. 24-101 (Feb. 2025) addressing skill-based contest classification, concluding that platforms where user skill is the predominant factor in determining outcomes are not gambling under Cal. Penal Code § 330. While this opinion is favorable to Styx, it expressly noted that the AG retains enforcement discretion where "the practical operation of a platform diverges from its stated design." Styx must ensure that its actual operation — particularly forfeiture redistribution mechanics — mirrors its legal position paper.

**Illinois:** The Illinois AG issued Opinion No. 15-006 (2015), analyzing DFS platforms under the Illinois Criminal Code. The opinion noted that "the operator's collection of a fee from the total pool is a factor in gambling analysis" and declined to provide a blanket safe harbor for all DFS operators. While the *Dew-Becker v. Wu*, 2020 IL 124472, decision subsequently clarified that skill-based contests are not gambling, the AG's 2015 opinion remains influential in shaping enforcement posture. [COUNSEL: CONFIRM whether the Illinois AG's office has issued updated guidance post-*Dew-Becker*.]

**Rebuttal:** In each of these jurisdictions, the initial enforcement posture was resolved in favor of skill-based platforms — either through legislation (New York), favorable AG opinion (California), or court ruling (Illinois). Styx's proactive compliance infrastructure (Aegis Protocol, geo-blocking, terminology sanitization) is designed to avoid triggering the optics-based enforcement that motivated the Schneiderman cease-and-desist.

### 10.5 "House Always Wins" Optics

**Argument:** Because Styx collects a flat platform fee from every user at enrollment and profits more when users fail (more forfeitures enlarge the redistribution pool available to successful users, increasing platform attractiveness and potentially driving growth), regulators may characterize this as a "rake" on a gambling operation where the house has a structural advantage. *See* Illinois AG Opinion No. 15-006, at 11 (2015) (noting that the operator's collection of a fee from the total pool is a factor in gambling analysis). The counterargument is particularly sharp: unlike a neutral SaaS platform, Styx's redistribution mechanics create a financial dynamic where the platform benefits from user failure — more forfeitures mean a larger redistribution pool, which makes the platform more attractive to prospective users, driving enrollment and fee revenue.

**Rebuttal:** A flat service fee is the standard monetization model for software-as-a-service (SaaS) and professional coaching platforms. Unlike a gambling "rake" or "vigorish," which is often a percentage of the total wagered pool or the winnings, Styx's fee is a transparent payment for access to the platform's verification, ledger, and behavioral engineering services. The critical distinction is structural: Styx's platform fee is a flat percentage of the deposit collected at enrollment, not a percentage of the forfeiture pool or the redistribution pool. The fee is earned at the moment of service provision (enrollment and tracking), not at the moment of "winning" or losing. The platform earns the same dollar amount from a user who succeeds as from a user who fails — the fee does not scale with forfeiture volume. *Cf.* Ian Ayres, *Carrots and Sticks: Unlock the Power of Incentives to Get Things Done* 16-22 (2010) (describing similar service fee models for behavioral commitment platforms where the platform's revenue is independent of user outcomes).

Furthermore, the growth-through-forfeiture argument conflates indirect market effects with the structural house-edge of a gambling operation. A gym that benefits from members who pay but do not attend is not a gambling house. A tutoring service whose reputation improves when students pass exams benefits from student success but does not "bet against" students who fail. Styx's financial structure is analogous: the platform's direct revenue (the fee) is outcome-independent, even if the platform's long-term market position may benefit from a robust redistribution pool.

## 11. Recommendations for Counsel

The following areas require formal legal opinion from outside counsel before Styx proceeds to real-money operations:

### 11.1 Classification Opinions Needed

1. **Skill-based contest confirmation.** Formal opinion that Styx qualifies as a skill-based contest under the dominant factor test in each target launch state.
2. **UIGEA exclusion applicability.** Opinion on whether the "contest of yourself" model falls within the § 5362(1)(E)(ix) exclusion, given the absence of case law directly addressing self-competition models.
3. **State blocklist completeness.** Review of whether the current blocklist (Arizona, Arkansas) is sufficient, or whether additional states should be excluded.
4. **Deposit-contract characterization.** Opinion on whether Styx's deposit structure can be characterized as a conditional deposit contract rather than "consideration" for gambling purposes.

### 11.2 Regulatory Filings

5. **State licensing review.** Determine whether any target launch state requires a specific license for skill-based contest platforms, daily fantasy sports operators, or similar categories.
6. **FTC compliance.** Review Styx's marketing claims and weight-loss outcome representations against FTC guidelines for weight-loss product advertising. *See* FTC, *Voluntary Guidelines for Providers of Weight Loss Products or Services* (1999).
7. **FinCEN registration.** Confirm that the FBO architecture eliminates the obligation to register as a Money Services Business under 31 C.F.R. § 1022.380.

### 11.3 Open Legal Questions

8. **Multi-user pool structures.** If Styx introduces group challenges where multiple users' forfeitures fund other users' payouts, does this create a "pool" that changes the legal classification?
9. **Referral bonuses and promotional credits.** Do promotional mechanisms (sign-up bonuses, referral credits) that add value to the prize pool without corresponding user deposits alter the chance/skill analysis?
10. **International expansion.** What regulatory framework applies if Styx expands to EU/EEA jurisdictions where gambling definitions differ from US law?
